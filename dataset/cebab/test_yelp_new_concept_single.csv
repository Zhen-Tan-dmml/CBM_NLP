"wasn't too impressed. staff was super friendly, patient, and helpful. line was HUGE and staff said it wasn't that bad, and gets way worse. wait to order was 20 minutes...and wait for food was about 10 minutes. they serve ice cream and cupcakes, or a combo of both. ice cream was hit and miss, we tried 5 different flavors and only really liked about 2. i like the capn' crunch flavor, sandwiched between two peanut butter/chocolate cookies. it was HUGE. couldn't finish it all. none of my party tried the cupcakes, but they looked good. would I go back? don't think so...but the Linq is pretty nice.",3,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown
"The restaurant and the bakery are a must stop for me when I'm in town. There was a conference at the Venetian and the bakery that's inside had a line through the casino. I remembered this location and quickly ducked out of the conference to stop by to grab a coffee and breakfast pastry. I was so glad because this location was basically empty when I stopped in. Food: You cannot go wrong with anything you order from their bakeries. I've tried a number of things from them and my favorites are the oh-oh, chocolate croissant, mini brownie and toffee candy. I usually order an iced vanilla latte for my coffee choice too; it's better than the coffee chains nearby. Staff: Everyone is usually friendly and efficient with your order. I never have to wait too long even if the line is long. Location: this one is tucked away outside of the Venetian. It's upstairs from the Walgreens. Because it's kind of tucked away the line never gets that long.",4,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown

The crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e was amazing! The custard was so creamy & not overly sweet. My sister is addicted to the salted caramel brownies. I'm not a fan of it though. It's good but just a tad bit too sweet for me. The coffee is great, the employees are so friendly, the sweets are awesome, & they're open 24/7! Yes! 24/7! Can't get any better than that!

We told the employee we'd never been before and she was super nice. She began pulling out mini little silver spoons and offering us samples. I ultimately went with the salted caramel & milkiest chocolate scoops. The texture was my favorite part, it's tough to describe. Very creamy and smooth. My fiance loved the gooey butter cake. For the two of us it was about $12. Pricey but a fun experience. We'll be back!",4,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"I never got the chance to try the original location in California so I am happy I did since we got to stay at the Cosmopolitan. Since COVID, the hours and days are different for when they are open but if they are when you come you should definitely come try out their menu items. I went with their famous MILK butter pie. Rich buttery and great for a snack. If you feel adventurous you can try out their crazy concoctions of ice cream but I wanted something simple.",4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"My friend said a general rule of thumb is that if something looks good here, it is. I tried A LOT of stuff and everything was really good. Workers are hit or miss. Some of them were knowledgeable, and others just don't care. I asked one worker what the flavors of the chocolate cups were. She said, ""I don't know"". I waited and then she started guessing on a few of them but trailed off. I pointed at one, and I said, ""The one with the almond. Is that almond?"" and she said, ""Yeah, I think so."" I think her name was Mac. I wish she had a nametag on that said, ""Don't ask me"". She could have also easily asked the guy next to her. I highly recommend the chocolate cups. My favorite was the passion fruit one. And the French macaroons (macarons)... sooo good. I prefer the cream ones and my favorite was pistachio. I didn't like the cinnamon-sugar one - too grainy. I wish I had bought a gazillion and stuffed them in my suitcase to bring back with me. Go here! You will not regret it. Just be careful, with this combo of deliciousness and semi-priceyness, you might go broke.",4,Positive,unknown,Negative,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"The 3 star rating is based purely on the coffee and lobster tail. I would definitely visit again and try more treats to see if there's something better. When I went in the late morning there were only a few people in the store so I was served quickly and there was a large variety of items available. I ended up choosing the original lobster tail, which I was told had Bailey's flavored cream inside. I also got a hot coffee, which was a lot cheaper than I expected! Employees were friendly and helpful when I asked about flavor options. The downside was that there really wasn't any seating, so my husband and I wandered around the shops until we found a bench. The lobster tail was really crisp. Like really crisp. Causing an explosion of powdered sugar on my shirt and pants. The pastry dough tasted a bit stale, but I don't have much lobster tail experience so maybe this is the intention? The cream was indeed Bailey's flavored and plentiful. Definitely a messy pastry to eat on a bench, so I'd keep that in mind!",3,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

A great bakery in the heart of Little Italy. It was the only place open semi-late (9pm) on a weeknight in the area where we could grab dessert. I ended up with the cappuccino brownie and it was fantastic. Some of the staples like cassata cake were already sold out but they had quite the selection of desserts still available.

"5-Star - cereal milk soft serve 3-Star everything else. I ordered the gift box that came with: -cereal milk soft serve (cereal topping included) -slice of crack pie --on the sweet side. Was able to share this piece with 3 others, and even then I wished it came with a smaller piece. - 3 birthday cake truffles --wayyy too sweet. Skip this. -compost cookie--honestly could not understand the hype about this product. The whole thing came out to $23 or $24. Note I think if you bought each individually it would be about the same price... All in all, I am glad I tried all of the famous items on the menu, but I will come back for the soft serve only! Maybe I'll even be adventurous and try the crack pie soft serve next!",4,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"Fresh ice cream, great service, served in a bright/open setting: that's the Mitchell's experience! This location, in Ohio City, is right in the middle of great restaurants and shopping, and it's the place we go to for dessert after spending a few hours dining and exploring the area. The store-front is located in front of their large processing facility, so you can see the actual fresh ingredients going into their product. Nothing to hide hear: you can literally stand along a glass wall and watch ice cream being made! While you're there, don't forget to get some to go home with -- they'll even sell you some dry ice to make sure it makes it home safely. Seriously, I cannot get enough of this place. You should go NOW!",5,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive
"Yes, it is hyped up because of David Chang. No it is not the same as the Milk bar on the east coast in regards to sitting in and dining. It is as stated, a ""bar"" that serves quick desserts. Much like an expensive Starbucks, created by a 2 Star Michelin Chef... It is a very good option for dessert. Being local I've been back a few times during the day - no long lines and one Saturday night during CES and was 12 deep. Not a factor cause the staff was prepared and had the line moving pretty well. Each time that I have went, the staff was really helpful and if there was a lag in service, they apologized cause some of them were still learning how to make certain things. The Crack Pie - on point, just like the one I tried at the east coast Milk Bar. The crack pie in shake form - yeah 10 bucks but it is Vegas. Competition will cause the prices to lower a little and stabilize. (maybe) Really sweet and rich - so bring your sweet tooth or have something pretty savory beforehand. Cookies - had them all but my fav is the compost and Corn flake with choc. and marshmallow. The one I liked the least was the chocolate chocolate chip. That was a little too sweet for me but I'm sure there are people out there who like them. Birthday cake Truffle - Was ok to me but my cousin loves them. They don't have the steam buns... Yet, but I am hoping that will happen. Sad to see some of the reviews be really picky with a place that just opened up. Give it a second chance and see how they have evolved to work out their kinks. I know that some are looking for that ""experience"" - I get it. Then dine in at Momofuku for that. I'm glad that Momofuku and Milk Bar are here and I look forward to returning.",4,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"We stopped by on a Friday night 40 minutes before their closing time, and the line was still pretty long! The menu is up on the wall so we had enough time to look it over and see what we wanted. The decor is super cute inside, and the lighting is perfect for some great pictures! They do have limited seating and they have a few tables outside as well. We were lucky to find us a little corner to sit down at, as everything else was already occupied. It was dirty though and had ice cream all over. We ended up ordering one Thai tea with boba and a vanilla cone with fruity pebbles and sprinkles. Our total was close to about $12.. Yikes, a little too high in my opinion.... The cashier was beyond friendly and he got us through quickly! We sat down and waited for our treats. The ice cream was pretty good and it was very creamy. We enjoyed the Thai tea (it was nothing special) and the boba was perfectly made. It was the right amount of chewyyyyyy! *It can get pretty expensive especially if there are a lot of ppl in your group. We don't have that big of a sweet tooth, so we ended up sharing our ice cream cone between three people. I can't imagine how much it would've been if we had all ordered one... Do come though cause it's pretty neat inside and a bunch of their other drinks look really cool and tasty! I will be back again to try those out.",4,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown
"Amazing donuts for affordable prices. I went in around noon, and they had a special of buy 1 get 1 free OR buy a box for $10. I'm not a huge donut fan because bread + lots of sugar makes me feel sick so I only got 2! (They close until all the donuts are all sold) FOOD 5/5: -Creme Brulee ($2): This is what their famous for because INSIDER FOOD showcased this particular donut online and it became a hit! I LOVED it, I'm a fan of regular creme brulee, and they did an amazing job of filling the cream inside the donut & having a sweet/crunch on the top. -Old Fashion Glazed (Free): This was fantastic! If your not into all the sweetness and bread, I strongly recommend this donut. Simple but very good. SERVICE 5/5: -Right when you get in your greeted by smiles and whoever is working is more than happy to recommend what they're most famous for & what flavors you like!",4,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown
"A great little place to escape the chilly Illinois weather! I stopped in here for coffee with a friend one day, had never tried this spot but have heard good things (and really wanna check out The Literary as well!) I was just looking for a cup of warmth and maybe a couple of sweet treats. We went in and it was so cute and intimate, a little bar near the window, some tables in the corner to work at, and a nice comfy couch with a gorgeous coffee table in the middle of the space. The walls were lined with various jams, cocktail mixes, teas, and coffees you could buy to try. A great little area to peruse while waiting for your coffee and food. I ended up ordering the Salted Orange Mocha and my friend got a Plain Black Coffee, I paired my yummy mocha with a decadent ooey-gooey salted caramel brownie and a flakey buttery classic croissant. The brownie was so rich and the salted caramel balanced it out nicely so the chocolate wasn't too overpowering. The croissant was very buttery and had a nice crisp flakey outside. The inside was fluffy and had those beautiful croissant layers you look for. My mocha really shocked me, surprisingly I don't typically like chocolate and orange together but I do love trying new things. The orange in this is super soft and doesn't have quite the punch I thought it would, it dances over your tongue and gets enveloped by the mocha. It's a very subtle concoction and I would definitely order it again! Overall this was a great coffee spot and it wasn't too crowded when we went in the afternoon. I think it may be a little overlooked with all the coffee shops on campus and downtown Champaign, I definitely think Hopscotch needs more recognition especially with all their cool coffee creations. I can't wait to go back and see what else they have to offer! * * * Check out my Instagram thatfoodiewithglasses",4,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown

The shop is located in the older downtown section of Las Vegas but we made a special trip to find them on recommendation of a friend who lives locally and were not disappointed! Some of the best donuts ever. Don't miss out on the poppa tart, which is a giant pop tart shaped donut decorated like a pop tart and then has an actual entire pop tart inside it when you bite in!! Also the candied bacon apple fritter is banging!! Creme BrÃ»lÃ©e, PBJ bar and blueberry myer lemon all amazing!

"This little gem was recommended to me by my cousin. When I was in NY, I missed it and was determined to find it while staying in Vegas. I tried the salted caramel macaron (pretty big), better nutter cookie sandwich (best thing ever for peanut butter lovers), chocolate croissant, and a regular croissant. Everything was ON POINT! So glad I was able to find this place, since it's a bit hidden. Must try while in Vegas. Located at The Venetian. They have several locations so hopefully you'll be able to find one of them.

"Great Dessert Place! Looking for something to satisfy your dessert craving? I recommend checking this place out! They have a variety of desserts here. They have a selection of different ice creams, my faves were the pistachio, the taro, and believe it or not, the unicorn poop, lol. The unicorn poop is purple vanilla ice cream with sprinkles. The Cookie Monster was good too, but it's very sweet. They also have boba, shaved ice drinks, floats and sobets. They have three non dairy ice cream flavors as well. What I got was the halo halo, a Filipino traditional dessert. They have a super special option that includes buko pandan. They top it with something crunchy which adds more texture to the halo halo. I enjoyed it! The way to eat a halo halo is to just go ahead and mix it all up. In Tagalog, halo halo, means mix mix, which is exactly the way to eat it. All the flavors become mixed together and it makes for a nice cold tasty treat!",5,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"You ever take a bite of something so good, and for just a split second you're mad? Like you've wasted so much time on other things? Their oatmeal pie is incredible. It's without a doubt the best oatmeal cookie I've ever had and the cream filling is a perfect compliment. It's not too sweet. It's a hefty sandwich about the size of a hamburger with a price to match, but it's worth every penny. We bought some other treats that we haven't even touched but if they're even half as good as the oatmeal pie they'll be fantastic.",5,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

If the donuts didn't do me in, the coffee did because it rocked my Friday morning. It was all so good I bought a round back for my co-workers to share the wealth.

"One of the iconic places on State, my roommate and I visit this place a lot when we stayed downtown. Even after moving to west Madison, we still go back pretty often when we are on State. You just can't say no to ice-cream, rich and creamy ice-cream. They have disclaimers that give you plenty of heads-up as to what is in store for you. Lots of milk, cream, dairy products, chocolates or whatever the flavor of the ice-cream is. My favorites are the zanzibar (three different types of chocolates, can it get better??), oreo espresso, and black raspberry. As it varies from person to person, the best way is still to try their generous samples and just see which one bought you over. Their menu also extends to sundaes, milkshakes, take-home pints etc, just in case you want to deviate a little from the usual cones or dishes.",4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Talk about a Hidden Gem!!!!!! Took my family on a little Spur of the moment Adventure downtown to visit a restaurant. The restaurant was decent not unimpressed however not impressed. That is until we decided to visit the little shops behind it. Only a few were open however one that was open at the time made our trip completely worth it!!! Novel ice cream shop !!!!! It is tucked away in a little cottage that used to house POWs in Phoenix from World War II. So the history behind it is pretty cool however that's nothing compared to The Taste, the Quality and the Service you will get from this little ice cream shop!!!! All of their ice cream is made from scratch, by hand....and I don't mean in a big vat. I mean by hand a few quarts at a time. They let our entire family taste each one of the flavors before we decided on our favorites. They serve it in cones, cups or between a waffle however my recommendation is the way we had it which is stuffed in a donut believe it or not! The donut was fresh and warm and ice cream was amazingly cold inside. Talk about sinful. Lol And of course the ice cream was amazing however shadowed slightly by the two people own the place !

When we got to the front, I realized the line wasn't too bad, it's the people. They were all really slow. I think they should change the way they take orders, to be more efficient. I got a regular cannoli, chocolate cannoli and a lobster tail. I'd say it's pretty expensive, but it is Vegas. I wonder if the other locations are the same price. I thought both cannolis were pretty good and had a nice crunch to them. The lobster tail was definitely my favorite. I really liked the cream inside and the crispy pastry layers!

"I am a fan...and because of that, I stop pretty frequently...I'd say more than 50% of the time that I motor north into the Great Shining Beacon on the side of McDowell Mt. and Pinnacle Peak called ""North Scottsdale"", I stop off for cup or a cone! The ice cream is made with love and craftsmanship that surpasses that of most of the restaurants in the Greater Phoenix area...I really do love their Madagascar Vanilla Bean ice cream! Wonderful, delightful sweet treats...just about the best ice cream that I've ever had (and that includes the homemade frozen custard that I used to make...and I will tell you that nobody appreciates my own cooking more than I do!). So, Donald, why only 4 stars for the Republic? Is it just me? Am I xenophobic?...have something against ice cream based governmental systems?...maybe a lactose intolerance based grudge against the Republic and those for which it stands? No...no...I just want a smile out of somebody when I buy a cup or a cone and then maybe spend another $20-30 to take a little frozen delight home to the Beautiful Carin...I've been in this place 20 times or more and I never get more than a ""next"" out of the people dishing out the scoops! Or a hurried ""will that be all?"" when they are ready for me to be done and pay and get going... I try to chat...even stuff like ""how's your day?"" and ""boy, that looks great!"" is met with silence. Maybe it's just me... Last week, I dropped by on my way home from a visit with one of my attorneys (and you can believe me when I say I really needed a treat). It wasn't a busy afternoon...but again...I was greeted with...indifference. There was a sign in the window advertising for help...wanting people ""passionate"" about being there...OK, I see the passion in the ice cream...and the customer service isn't bad...not really...they always get to me eventually and I get what I want...but I couldn't say that anyone behind the counter has ever smiled at me...chatted with me...even when taking my money...sometimes quite a bit of money...it's a little bit disconcerting...

"Went to grab dessert at night and figured why not try the gourmet chocolatier shop here as it's close to the Linq, where we were staying. Unfortunately, their machine broke or something which meant my cravings for a shake were crushed. Didn't think I came to a McDonalds, but alright. Four stars for a slightly above average experience despite not being able to snag a shake. More like a 3.5 probably. Line was extremely long but the staff were great. Location is amazing as it's in the heart of the strip and on the promenade. Prices and value suck but you come for the experience at least once. Anyways, the ice cream scoops are generous and I regretted opting for a triple scoop. I contemplated throwing away my bowl because it was so much but as an ice cream fanatic, I couldn't bring myself to do that. Friend got a scoop in the sugar cone and the cone was challenging to hold because the scoop was ginormous. Another friend opted for the Drinking Chocolate. Well, it's literally melted chocolate, extremely dense with chocolate. It was a debate between that or the hot chocolate and he noted he would get the standard hot chocolate in the future. The Drinking Chocolate is for true chocolate fanatics, not just anyone.",4,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,Negative,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Good donuts, damn good donuts. What else is there to know? Ah... if you insist... So I guess this place is famous. I didn't know, I just came downtown to pay a ticket and saw a neat little sign for a donut shop. Inside I go and I'm just blown away by the different types of donuts on display! Homer's donut? Matcha donut? Nutella donut? What!? Which should I try? The answer is ALL OF THEM! Haha okay not really, but I did buy a dozen. The french toast donut was my favorite. I believe they make it on request because mine came out hot, and I did have to wait additional time for it. It comes with syrup on the side as well. My only regret is not buying two! It was that good. I loved Homer's donut as well. I believe that was strawberry flavored icing on top? It was simple, but great. The strawberry split was SO good! My partner loved how it wasn't too sweet, and loved having creme and strawberries in the donut. I didn't order the creme brulee donut this time, but I hear it's their signature donut. Heck, they all look and taste like signature donuts! Instead of cooking breakfast I think I'll just order a french toast donut from here instead. It was bigger than all the donuts and very filling. They close when they're out of donuts and trust me, they will run out. I recommend arriving early as there's usually no line. Definitely a must try when you're in Las Vegas! PROTIP: Their menu changes DAILY! You can also order in advance on their website only during THE DAY BEFORE! And it has to be a dozen donuts, minimum. I believe the deadline is 6pm, but I could be mistaken. This saves a lot of time during busy weeks if there's a festival going on in the city.",5,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Had the worst experience here on a Monday afternoon. My two friends and I walk in and we were the ONLY people by the registers/dessert bar waiting to order desserts. The kid who with the brown hair and glasses that worked there kept calling out numbers (apparently you're suppose to grab a ticket when you walk in which Happens to be on the side where people exit) and they serve you according to your ticket number (because we live in the god damn 50's) My friends and I stood there for about 10 minutes when we finally ask if we can order desserts. The kid working there then scolds us about how we can only be served if we grab a ticket. I then replied that we will grab a ticket and the employee says ""I will serve you this time BUT NEXT TIME... Grab a ticket"" well guess what asshole, there won't be a next time. How about you serve your guests who are clearly not familiar with your stupid ticket service and kindly explain to them how your system works rather than making them feel like a moron. As our horrible experience continues, my friend orders about 4-5 delicious looking desserts. The employee then decides to make the rudest comment to her ""you know that saying... Don't go grocery shopping if you're hungry"" no sir, we do not know that saying, please elaborate where your are going with this statement. Sorry for ordering desserts and supplying you with a paycheck, maybe next time we will order one single cookie so you can make 2.34$ an hour. As my friend was being ""served"" by this four eyed ass hat I was patiently waiting to be served also. I look over at the other employee who continues to flip his ticket numbers and shouting out numbers. We were still the only people at the dessert bar.... seriously?! Clearly this employee was also a moron. Finally the first employee finishes helping my friend and I ask him what his favorite dessert is. He replies ""Well I don't eat junk food"" .......... ....... ............... Is this a fucking joke? You work in the restaurant industry clearly at a place that serves desserts and your response is that you don't eat junk food? Are you calling your employers delicious desserts ""junk""? Nice I did not know how to respond to this peasants comment, so I continued to order what I thought looked good. I then ask him how they serve the biscotti cookies and he replies ""we sell them by the pound"" I then asked if I could get a half pound of biscotti cookies and he looks at me and asks "".......well how many do you want"" I then said ""I want a half pound"" and he says ""yeah but how many do you want?"" I thought to myself ""Are you fucking with me child?"" I will take four cookies- I responded. They had two different cookies and I asked if the sign referred to the bottom ones ( the sign said cinnamon) and the worker responds ""um yeah... S is for cinnamon"" um, okay. Finally he rang me out and I tipped him. I'm not sure why honestly. Probably because he was towering over me as I was signing my receipt. I would have rather donated my money to starving homeless people in Cleveland. Worst customer service I have EVER experienced and we will never go back. Very sad considering the desserts were amazing.",1,Positive,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown

"This place was worth dusting off my keyboard for a yelp review. Precious describes the service, and Precious is the name of the woman who helped us. She was really cool and accommodating to me and more so to my kid, which is the way to my heart. My son apparently loves the place, and Precious wanted to help him out, decide what he should buy (he bought a bunch of cookies to bring back to his friends.) She was very down to Earth about it, and I appreciated it. She also seemed to enjoy her job and seemed like she actually liked the product she was selling. Shout out to the other two people there, all together, running a good thing. The 5 stars are because, with all that said above, the Milk Bar is also cool idea. Breakfast cereal and whole milk, turned into cookies and ice cream. I think it builds on that theme. And, the milk shakes we got were really good(we haven't tried the cookies yet.) My kid got the peppermint bark, and I got the cereal and milk with fruity pebbles. Beyond that, the location in the Cosmopolitan is awesome. I dug the hotel and the vibe and you gotta walk through the place to get to the Milk Bar. The only thing I'll say about prices, you're not just paying for quality, you're paying for the novelty and uniqueness of what they're selling. They basically have stuff that's really good, that you can't really get anywhere else. Overall, it's a great place, good people, amazing desserts, and it's fun to get there, ie, walk through the swanky Cosmopolitan.",5,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive

"Okay, so the first time I've ever heard of Sprinkles is when it opened in Las Vegas. I know, I know, I'm ""deprived"" or whatever you'd like to call it. Anyways, I went to the Linq with two of my friends with the intention of trying Sprinkles for the first time! Whenever I go to a popular cupcake place, if they have red velvet ... then that will be the flavor I'll be trying. It also helps that people rave about it. First off, they kind of have a ""schedule"" of flavors for the cupcakes. Certain flavors of cupcakes are only available certain days of the week. There are a few, however, that are available all the time, which includes their red velvet and vanilla I believe. So if there's a certain flavor you want to try, make sure to check their schedule! Each cupcake is $3.75, which seems normal (kind of....) for one of these popular cupcakeries. What's great is that they even have a mini cupcake treat available for you to buy for your dog for $2.50. My friend actually bought one for her doggie :) Awwww. Also love the fact that the plate they give you and the fork/knife are all wooden! It's cute and eco-friendly! When I first took a bite of the red velvet, I'll admit ... it wasn't heaven. BUT it was really good. The cake was really moist and flavorful. The frosting was really sweet and heavy, but that is what you expect from a cream cheese frosting. Sprinkles is probably one of the few places that could make a red velvet cupcake correctly. I've tried a lot of different ones and not all are as moist as Sprinkles so yay! Now I'm a little interested in how their Strawberry cupcake tastes like. I had considered getting one but ... I wasn't sure if I could finish it or if my friends wanted to help me finish it boooo They also have a ""Cupcake ATM"" outside. From what I heard, it's supposed to be 24 hours? You can order their cupcakes and/or cookies from it. However, the prices of the cupcakes, from what I noticed, is about 50 cents more expensive. I guess because it's 24 hours? Or the novelty of it? If it weren't for the fact that it's on the strip, I would go to Sprinkles more often. Alas, for me, it's not worth the trouble.",4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"Happy Birthday Donut Bar- 3 years old today!!!!! Such an accomplishment, and continuing to rock and sell out all the time. They have made the top 10 donut establishments across the country. When we arrived there was a line of patrons waiting and wanting to try these amazing delectable delights. There are so many to choose from. From Unicorn to Peanut butter and Jelly. Each is made fresh and they are differently priced. Upon entering off of 6th and Carson entrance, you walk up and are quickly greeted by wonderful counter people. They have so many options and are willing to take their time with you. They have espresso and coffee options as well. There is a small counter you can sit at, however seating is very limited. I obviously got several to say the least. The owner is very personable as I got the chance to meet him today. Pricing is a reflection of quality and presentation. Would def recommend.

The guy was really excited to torch the marshmallow fluff i ordered and it was perfect. Ice cream was amazing as expected. I got a double scoop because my eyes are bigger than my stomach and it was too much. Peanut butter tastes like a cookie as opposed to from out the jar. Tiramisu has the right hint of amaretto. Oh I also grabbed one of those salted caramel things in the front. I assume it's house made but wow it's so buttery salty and 50 cents! Hehe get one on the go.

Trust me it was...and i don't even care for vanilla ice cream...but it may be the best i have ever had. They make the ice cream by hand and it is an all natural Artisian ice cream made from all natural and local ingredients.

"I was there for the first time on Sunday. I ordered a loaf of bread, turkey cheese sandwich and a lavendar lemonade to go. I never was told where to go get my drink, so I sat there with my number sign and waited, and waited and saw people who came in after me served promptly. So I wondered over to what looked like the place to get drinks and asked if a Lemonade was made long ago. I was told no, so I thought can I get one as I have been waiting now well into 20 min. I asked the gal who made sure to make at least five drinks for people who came in after me and get around slowly to making my drink. So, happy to sip the drink I waited, and waited for someone to collect my number (which was 1) and saw others get their food promply and I was never approached by a staff member to be asked what I ordered. After 30 min or so I flagged down someone and asked where and when I might get my food. Well, they had no idea what my order was and after roughly 45 minuted I got my order after pleading with a staff member. They threw in a cup of soup for the mix up but I have been a server in the past and felt that the cashier dropped the ball somehow as she saw how long I waited and never acknowledged me after I paid. It was early afternoon and slightly busy, but still they need more people making drinks and calling drinks loudly to the crowd waiting so they know what's going on and give instruction to people at point of check out where to go get beverage.

"Went at about 6:30 and I was able to try the specialties they had first... Aztec Chocolate was really good with a little bite at the end would recommend but I was looking for a sweet, sweet treat tonight... So I also tried the Dulce de Leche flavor and it was delicious... I got a scoop of vanilla bean and a scoop of dulce de leche... It came in a cool little Chinese takeout box with a fortune cookie... Would highly recommend especially if you have an out-of-towner...

My husband got the French toast (good but I'm not a big maple syrup fan - at least not in ice cream). He also got an award winning salted caramel ice cream that was PERFECTION.

"Christina Tosi is my favorite baker. The treats and desserts you get at Milk Bar are unlike anything you have ever had before. The success of Milk Bar can be summed up by saying it's the perfect combination of science and creativity. Cookies (4-5 stars) All are at least 4 stars but the sure winners are the Cornflake Chocolate Chip Marshmallow Cookie (which tastes like Frosted Flakes had a baby with a chocolate chip cookie) and the Compost Cookie (which incorporates salty treats to the sweet cookie to create a flavor explosion). Crack Pie (4.5 stars) - Don't think of this as pie. If you compare it to traditional pie, you may find it odd. Think of it more as if a butter cookie was fused with pie crust. It's unlike any dessert on the planet. It's equally as buttery as it is sweet and very satisfying. Cereal Milk Milkshake (3 stars) - The first few sips are incredible. It really does taste like cereal milk blended with ice cream. BUT it's incredibly sweet. So sweet that my husband and I couldn't even finish TOGETHER their smallest sized shake. If you can handle a ton of sugar, go for it! But if you're a weakling like me... maybe pass or just be OK with throwing some away. Birthday Cake (4.5 stars) - It's visually stunning! The cake is very spongy and light. And there are funfetti cookie dough crumbles throughout. This would be the world's perfect cake if it wasn't for... CHOCOLATE Birthday Cake (5 stars) - I normally don't like chocolate cake that much. I almost always prefer vanilla. But this one, WOW! The cake tastes like an Oreo Cookie in cake form. And the frosting tastes very similar to Oreo Cream. Also... We bought this cake and I totally forgot about it (because I normally don't want Chocolate cake). I ate it a whole WEEK after we bought it and the cake was still soft, spongy, and fresh as if it was just made that day.",5,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

I walked in ready to buy a bunch of chocolates. I had my mask on but my husband had a drink so he wasnt wearing one. The guy behind the counter very rudely told my husband to put his mask on. When my husband turned around to show him he was drinking, the guy told him to either put his mask on his ear or to leave the store, meanwhile there were 5 other people eating and drinking that he did not tell this to. We have no problem wearing masks but this was ridiculous and no one should be treated like this, especially loyal customers.

"In looking for another ice cream place in Las Vegas, we ended up here. Intrigued by the business name, we approached and saw that they serve soft serve. One of the soft serve flavours is ""Cereal Milk"". I asked the server what it tasted like and he said, ""It's really hard to describe the taste, other than cereal milk."" So I replied, ""So....vanilla?"" And he said ""No, not vanilla. Let me give you a sample."" So he gave me a sample and the rest is history. It tasted like cereal milk! I said to the server, ""OMG this tastes like cereal milk"", and he laughed and said ""I know, hard to describe otherwise!"" Now I'm not usually an ice cream eater but I had to order myself a cup of this cereal milk soft serve, which blew my mind every time I tasted it. They had other flavours too, but honestly I couldn't tell you what they were - I didn't pay attention because I was so blown away by the cereal milk flavour. I did notice that they sell the flavour mixture so you can create your own cereal milk ice cream at home. So, it's no secret that the flavour is achieved by adding corn cereal powder to ice cream, among other things I'm sure. Next time I'm in Las Vegas, with kids or otherwise, I'm totally hitting this place up again!",5,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive

"Have always wanted to try the Momofuku milk bar in New York and never got the chance, so I was super excited to find this place in LV. Turned out to be my biggest disappointment in an ice cream, EVER. I got the signature cereal milk soft serve. The ice cream itself lacked richness and taste, felt like a weird middle ground between ice cream and sorbet. The cornflakes were not ordinary cornflakes. They were not flakes first of all; they were crushed and stuck together. They were not as crunchy; it felt like they have been left out for a while. Worst of all, they were SALTY. Who had the ingenious idea of combining salty and sweet?! And the price. The soft serve itself is 6$ and the cornflakes are an extra 1.25$. The whole thing comes out to about 8$ with tax. I have never paid so much for an ice cream and this is the worse ice cream I've ever had (I didn't even finish it... Me! Not finishing an ice cream?!). Perfect combination for a 1-star.",1,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"This is a fairly average cafe overall. The food offerings are slight and not meal-level, the pastries (that I've had) are unimpressive, the coffee is mediocre, the layout is spastic, the furnishings are uncomfortable, it is not particularly good for pleasant conversation or getting work done. It is, however, open 24 hours everyday and that makes it a great destination after 11:00pm when all the other cafes in town have closed. The service is good and the people working there are very friendly -- just as I would expect for such a friendly city. It has great potential if they can upscale the tables and chairs to more practical and comfortable pieces, improve the lighting, decrease the background noises, and make the layout more attractive, functional, and cohesive.",3,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"I am officially in love. Sinful Sweets DESTROYS any chocolate/candy store in existence. Not only do they have awesome, friendly, fun staff, but the expansive selection of chocolates, truffles, cake pops AND ice cream is fantastic. They even have samples of their chocolate out to try! Sure, the building this little place resides in may be a bit run down, but I think it just gives it personality! The shop inside is cute and modern. Milkshake Happy Hour (25% off from 4-7 p.m.)!! The girl working (I wish I'd gotten her name!) was awesomely patient and helpful as I debated for several minutes between flavors. Finally, I decided to go wild and got bittersweet symphony (coffee & chocolate), mint chocolate chip, red velvet, chocolate cookie dough & piece of cake (since you get four scoops of ice cream, I split the cake and cookie dough flavors). At my request, she blended in tons of (free!) extras, like Reese's and Butterfingers pieces. Finally, I asked her to top my shake with Andes mints, which she did enthusiastically. It came with a big, fat cute straw DIPPED in chocolate on the tip for an extra burst of chocolately goodness with each sip. She said it was the craziest shake she had made yet :) IT WAS HEAVEN. I'm surprised I didn't spiral into depression at the final sip. All the extras that didn't get blended in were at the bottom, soaked in milkshakey goodness, so I got to spoon it out for even more deliciousness. Go here.

"Updating my review to this place because I went back with my boyfriend a second time. Although the girl working was really nice, I had noticed that there were no chocolate based flavors. For how many options they had, I thought that was a little crazy to not have a traditional chocolate flavor (or even a chocolate peanut butter or something). Biggest reason for the review change---Last time I rated this place, my boyfriend was the one making the purchase, so he paid. This time, we went for the special they have which adds a macaroon and a toasted marshmallow on top of your ice cream. I thought the menu board said they were $10 each (which is too much money for what you get, in my opinion). I remember tipping on top of it. And then when I checked my bank statement the next day, it said I spent $28.24 here. Almost $30 for essentially two scoops of ice cream plus some toppings?! PASS! I don't think I'll come back here if these are their prices because their ice cream is not worth that much. Even had I tipped 20% (which I think I did), it should have been $25 (again too much....) so to randomly add an over $8 tip is outrageous for what you are getting. I'm not sure how that happened but I doubt I'd come back.

Was recently in Vegas and wanted to drop by to visit the famous Carlos Bakery from Cake Boss. It was actually very disappointing and a huge let down. All I tried was the chocolate cannoli so maybe I didn't have the right thing but... It was sold in a pack of 6 for $30. The favor was not there and it just tasted frozen.

"Truly a disappointing experience. Having been to many 85 locations in CA, I had high hopes that this location would be an amazing addition to my new hometown. I came on Sunday, 3/8/20 at about 5:30 pm. There was a long line but that didn't initially bother me. However, when you enter the store, the line for the checkout (staffed by one cashier) was wrapped around inside. The line was right thru the middle of the pastry selection area, making it difficult to make any selection for the few pastries that were out as the people in line wouldn't move, even after asking politely if you could reach around them to select a pastry. The young man at the checkout was pleasant and very apologetic for the wait. I assured him I knew it wasn't his fault. Inadequate staffing is a managers fault and I saw no manager assisting in the mess I saw occurring in that store. What disgusted me to no end was the employee working the coffee bar. His hair was unkept and long and sticking out everywhere. He seemed to have no feeling of any urgency to do his job, as he was wandering all over the store while people stood waiting for their drinks. He wandered several times to the back of the store behind the swinging doors and then would wander back to the coffee making area and never washed his hands. The part where I wanted to vomit was when he made the drink, then carried it over across the aisle with his hand over the top of the cup - now full with coffee (there is no assembly line format for making drinks so it's very disorganized). I know that a food handlers permit is required in CA so I'm going to assume that one is required in NV as well. All the things I saw with this last employee violate the health code. And with the world gone mad about the coronavirus, it would behoove this particular employee to take health precautions seriously or find other employment. I did not have him remake my drink (as I was late for an engagement). And didn't have time to wait another 30 mins for a drink.

"The best ice cream I have ever had! I know have a reason to move to Phoenix/Scottsdale and the reason is Sweet Republic. The menu is like a all star list of ice cream and it took me a while to make a decision of what to try beyond the obvious everything. I went for a classic with the Madagascar Vanilla and a unique flavor with the Honey Blue Cheese to try to get an idea of Sweet Republic's range. WOW, they blew me away. The honey blue cheese was an oddly wonderful taste that I enjoy in its normal incarnation but found the ice cream version to be somehow better! The flavors were well developed and not over powering, especially the blue cheese which could have been a bully and ruined everything. A subtly savory sweet treat! The Madagascar vanilla was nothing short of perfect, the flavor was dead on, texture was perfect and best of all the silky creaminess worked together to develop my first official ice cream addiction needing intervention. The iconic ice cream flavor has a new high mark set with this one. I will without hesitation go out of my way to stop in at Sweet Republic anytime I am in the state of Arizona. My only request (dream) is that they have a tasting menu. I would gladly hand over $10-20+ for a well rounded spoonful of each flavor available.

It is not obvious to find as the hotel malls themselves are a bit of a challenge to navigate through. Just as we were about to give up we found it...by luck. I got the fruity pebbles cereal soft serve. The soft serve was okay. I know that there are better ones in Vegas which I have been to (and will review later as I am catching up on all the Vegas reviews). It was super expensive, therefore, I shared a cone with my best friend which worked out for the best since we were going to a buffet later that day anyway. There is some sit down space inside but decided to just walk around the rest of the mall. Customer service was neutral.",3,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"I woke up this morning... 7 AM... because I was going to go try The Donut Bar. There was so much hype about this place from USA today to the food network to Ellen. I was energized and ready to go! I got there at 7:50 in the morning and it was easy to find parking. There was already a line of at least 40 people ahead of me who were also waiting for a shop that was about to open at 8 AM. The wait time to get in once the shop opens at 8 AM was 30 minutes in line outside. Luckily, it was a pleasant day. As I approached the inside of the store, I was surprised to see that I wasn't all that excited. I saw many very large looking donuts with hard tacky frosting that weren't at all appealing. The oversized amount made them less appealing rather than to appear yummy. The smaller donuts looked good and, by smaller, I mean normal size like Dunkin' Donuts regular donuts. The service was just OK. Whoever chose to run this place really doesn't seem to understand what the best environment for customer service is. It was glaring super loud music over the speakers where I could barely hear the person helping me and I'm not sure if they could hear me. I had to order several donuts for a party and thought this is a good place to try because it gets so much publicity so it has to be good. I decided to put my instincts aside because so many people were waiting in front of me and behind me to get into this place and it has gotten all these reviews. As I ordered, after two dozen donuts, the server just went off to help somebody else without even asking me if I was finished with my order. I couldn't believe it! I was very friendly during the whole interaction which is why this shocked me. I did not bother calling her back because I am not confrontational and simply will let something like this go, but won't let it go during a review. The donuts range from two dollars that are very small to some pastries that are upwards of four dollars. I ordered several donuts including the Twix, Samoa, blueberry with lemon, chai, Nutella, Red velvet, and the crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e. Here is what I have to say: firstly, you have to eat these donuts the day of because they are not as good the next day. With that being said, most of the donuts were not that impressive to begin with. They were just ok or disappointing. In fact, the crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e donut, which gets all of this amazing hype, was one of the worst ones of the bunch. The hard sugar/Caramel crust on top of the donut was so burnt that it carried a foul aftertaste. The donut itself had a yummy crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e center within the dough. The topping of the crunchy burnt sugar/Caramel ruined it. I also did not like that many of the donuts were grossly over sized with a great deal of tacky frosting on it which was glazed and dried off. I did order a couple of those and they were not very good. This place is OK. I did not try the coffee and I wonder if that would've changed my mind and increased their ratings. The donuts are so so. They aren't that much better than other places or don't cost a lot less so I do not know what people are talking about. Also, the wait time and price just isn't worth it. It is a very popular place and a lot of people come here. Not sure if there are people that love donuts so much that this is considered great quality??? I love food and have been very fortunate to taste some phenomenal food internationally at some of the best places. I know donuts and sadly, the donut bar does not have anywhere close to the best donuts around. The two stars are because it is expensive, the service was disappointing, the wait time to get the donuts was way too long for this,and the donuts did not impress. I am glad I tried it just take the hype away and I should have gone with my instincts.",2,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,unknown,Negative,unknown,Positive,Negative,Negative,Positive,unknown,unknown

"I had a breakfast sandwich, and it was just okay. It wasn't hot all the way through, so it wan't the best. The coffee was pretty good, and the honey bun I split with my bf was excellent. The staff was fairly nice, but not overly helpful. The worst was that there were some seriously annoying high school wannabe-hipster girls in there who were yapping loudly at the table next to us. One of them sent her food back because, as she told the server, she was ""allergic to dairy,"" even though she then told her friends (quite loudly) that, really, she was just ""trying the whole vegan thing, like, lol!""

I've had bites of Justin's dairy concoctions which have included: lavender, chocolate chip, and salted caramel. from memory, they haven't had mint chocolate chip yet, but I'm sure they will at some point! we've been twice now, but on the third time, when the line was over 20 minutes, we decided to bail. thrilled that CLT is one of the few cities that Jeni's has expanded to. it's such a bright (literally!) spot in South End which makes our neighborhood even better.",5,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown
Maybe it's because I was born and raised in Hoboken and was able to enjoy these pastries with no line before the fame so I may be biased.

"TAIPEI BAKERY EMPIRE 85° C BAKERY is mastering the bake industry like a monster typhoon. Huge dominance in So-Cal and now has moved north on I-95 anchoring itself as a foodie hot spot in Chinatown's Shanghai Plaza Las Vegas. Its actually a big bakery shop, but dine-in section is closed for good reasons. The area where you personally select your pasteries is a free for all zone without any observance for social distancing. Sorta like a mob after a storm when all the fish are washed a shore. It was a scene from a Charlie Chaplin fire drill. Then you get in a queue to pay, and it's stand apart with four feet spacing. The cashiers are spaced even closer. Thank goodness everyone is respectfully masked. I choose five pasteries and three I would buy again and again.

I heard heard numerous good things about this place and was so eager to try and see what that was all about. Unfortunately my experience was negative and I will not be returning. The afternoon my three friends and I walked into amazing customer service from a young boy who was so kind in serving our sweet treats, which were quite delicious. We sat inside the establishment that day because it was a little chilly. What unfolded afterwards blew my mind. It seems that the mother of the employee came in to speak to the (new) owner about a few issues so my company and I paid no attention. Shortly (and I mean very shortly) there after the management took the conversation to an altercation type level with raised voice and all. WE WERE SHOCKED. Owner was shouting, blaming the young boy aloud for a broken mug, saying he would not receive tips. I could NOT believe my eyes and ears. I felt awful for this boy and as customers, we were put in such an awkward position sitting there while this was taking place. Our sweet trip turned sour VERY quickly. It's a shame. We will not be returning and truly hope for the best of the employees that remain under the example of management we witnessed that afternoon.",1,Positive,Negative,Negative,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

Oh and just a note, you have to pay with cash or check as they do not accept credit cards. Back to the donuts. I got a variety and my co-workers all said they tasted really good so that is what I am basing my review on. I did eat one and it was A-Ok, but it tasted like a regular donut to me so I can't really rate it on taste since it's not my thing, but I would definitely suggest this place to anyone who likes donuts!

"Mitchell's is one of the things about Cleveland which will make it hard to leave when the time comes. I am not an ice cream person, but when I am, I am a snob. If it isn't great, it isn't worth it. First, I love that they are very open and honest and meticulous about where they source their ingredients. Everything that can be purchased locally, is purchased locally. Second, I love that they have interesting and unique flavors. The Edmund Fitzgerald Porter ice cream is my favorite that I have ever had. It is not uncommon to find a pint of it in my freezer. I've also been stunned by the decadence of the caramelized chocolate. I don't love chocolate ice cream, but this is just amazing. Not too sweet. I've also tried most of their seasonal flavors--berry crumble, peach, apple cider concoctions, pumpkin spice, juniper/olive oil/orange--all amazing. They taste exactly the way that they should taste except better and creamier. Third, having cut dairy almost completely out of my everyday diet, their vegan ice cream is fantastic. Their vegan ice cream is better than most regular ice creams. It is wonderful, rich, creamy, good flavors, absolute excellence. The cookie dough ice cream has massive chunks of cookie dough in it. The peanut butter chocolate concoctions have loads of peanut butter and chocolate. It's a beautiful thing. The portions are generous (I usually get a junior size or a pint to go).

You can get a box or bring a container here with you. Handcrafted doughnuts like these are better than any you get commercially. It tastes so much fresher, because these are actually made here. They always have a large variety. All the flavors sound good. Some of the flavors include classics like chocolate and vanilla. A few more exotic flavors include banana nut, maple with coconut bacon pieces, and strawberry. The donuts are $2 each, which isn't bad for something like this. It tastes just like regular donuts. That means they're good, and while they may not be much healthier they're made of higher quality. It doesn't have any room to sit inside.

I am always greeted with a smile and I feel welcomed anytime I come here. Now that I've tried other doughnuts in the Cleveland area, I will say that these are tasty. They are soft but actually a bit too sweet. It is almost as if you can taste the sugar. I especially feel this when I taste the Lavender doughnut. These are vegan doughnuts so they are made without milk. I do appreciate that the price has gone down from $3 a doughnut to $2 a doughnut which is affordable.

There is usually always a nice crowd in this shop...not crazy busy but good steady business. Who am I to delay people from their yummy goodness that is SR's ice cream? In any case, I usually end up going with tried and true favorites like I Love Bacon and Salted Caramel. This time around they didn't have the bacon ice cream so I went with their Sweet Potato and it was so delicious. Definitely put me in the mood for Thanksgiving! The quality of their ice cream is really great and you just can't beat some of their exciting flavor combinations. Basil Lime is so refreshing!

"Ok this is just a regular bakery at the Venetian right? Ummm this is one of the best bakeries I have ever been to in my life! The taste of all of their pastries is just mouth watering! - croissant: it is the flakiest buttery croissant I ever had! It's huge but will be gone in 3 seconds. There is a few different kinds of croissants and can't go wrong with any of them. But the best to me is the original one - macaroons: all huge! Usually macaroons are a bit chewy or dry. Their center filling is super creamy and light! Which was a shock for me. Can't go wrong with any of the flavors but my favorite is pistachio and earl grey! - muffins: honestly their muffin is great. It's super moist and chewy. Maybe I'm not a muffin fan. Wasn't that impressed - cookies: there is a few variations of cookies. All great but I still think I had better. All in all, great stop if your at the Venetian. They have sandwiches and coffee which I have yet to try. But if I wanted that then I would go to grand Lux next door and I feel like it would be a lot better. No you come here for bakeries. All are amazing and can't go wrong at all in any choice you make. The only down side is that the service is a bit slow, they aren't as organized, and under staffed where it is only one or two people working. Also, the price! It is Vegas after all but usually each baked goods will be about 5 bucks each. But the size does make up for it, still kind of pricey since I usually leave with a good box full. -",4,Positive,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"Mm mm, smells good, looks good, tastes good. Hit the trifecta. The glass cases are filled with gems. Fresh crusty breads with my favorite being their epi, a French bread that looks like a branch. It is beautiful gift when you are invited to dinner at friend's house. Their sweets are divine. Little sandwich cookies that are just plain beautiful and slices of apple cake. Their chocolate chip cookies are excellent. Scones and brownies call your name and you pace wanting to pick just the right thing.

"I literally cannot stop laughing about this place. I mean, the sheer audacity of Brandon and Jenny Douglas to serve such unapologetically sinful desserts like this is just beyond comprehension. Warm donuts stuffed with ice cream? Waffle ice cream sandwiches? With cereal toppings? And a variety of glass bottled soda offerings? To those grossed out by this boldness, you might as well leave this review now. Me? I just had to see this for myself. After a soft opening in early March, I went to the Grand Opening Saturday night, appropriately enough the same weekend as Art Detour. Located on Grand Avenue & Fillmore in the same complex as ThirdSpace, Novel occupies the red building in back that has seen a number of concepts come and go over the years, but none with such an eye popping slogan out front as ""Ice Cream Stuffed Donuts"". Downtown Phoenix is certainly a friendly breeding ground for entrepreneurial experimentation, but could something this crazy actually work? Brandon and Jenny were delightful from the moment I walked in the door, and you can pick up on just how passionately devoted they are to their bold new concept. The ice cream flavors are made to their own specs, the donuts and waffles are made fresh in house, and they'll pretty much let you sample as many flavors as you want. With bold flavors like Bourbon Caramel Toffee Crunch, Cookie Monster, and Panna Cotta Cherry, as well as more familiar offerings like Butter Pecan, Madagascar Vanilla, and Mint. I counted 14 different flavor offerings this go around. If the ice cream and pastry combination wasn't crazy enough, did I mention toppings? From cereals? You've got options like Captain Crunch, Cookie Crisp, Fruity Pebbles, Fruit Loops and even Cocoa Puffs. I was craving a waffle this go around, so for me tonight would be a date with me and the Leslie Knope. And yes that is an entirely intentional reference to Amy Poehler's character on Parks & Rec. Two fresh made waffles with ice cream and a topping in the middle. My kryptonite of choice? Honey Lavender ice cream and Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Normally $5, tonight it was discounted at $3 for the grand opening (though I would've happily paid $5 for this magic). After a few minutes it was put together and placed in wax paper for sandwich style portability. The first bite had me filled with thoughts that I should maybe be remorseful for this obscene creation, but no, no I was not remorseful at all. Let's pretend calorie and cholesterol numbers don't count and I'll instead just tell you this is really good for you, and it will make you happy. Add Novel to the growing list of great restaurants dotting the landscape on Downtown's Grand Avenue food scene including Treehouse Bakery, Irma's Kitchen, and Barrio Cafe Gran Reserva. In addition to donuts and waffles stuffed with ice cream and toppings, they offer soda floats, traditional ice cream scoops on a waffle (or pretzel) cone, and even an ice cream flight of 5 flavors. And not a single item on the menu is more expensive than $8. Novel might leave you laughing about what you've just done to your diet or embarrassed to admit what you've eaten, but I think you'll find the mixed emotions worth the trouble. It may be early in Brandon and Jenny's fledgling concept, but from what I can see, they've hit on a winner.",5,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Boasting an astonishing variety of lovingly prepared ice cream and related tempting sweet treats all served fresh in a crisp, state of the art environment, Mitchell's is a world class establishment through and through. Though they have gradually attained something of a celebrity status in recent years, the fine folks at Mitchell's sacrifice none of their grassroots integrity in pursuit of turning larger profits. And their flavors just keep on getting tastier. The pralines & cream, while a bit of an underdog, according to one staff member, may be the best ice cream I've ever had the extreme good fortune of tasting. The 25th Street location is a gem: a sort of space age Wonka's workshop looms behind the order line, offering guests a firsthand view of just where the magic happens.

"Good spot to grab some ice cream if you're staying @ the Palazzo (which we usually do), or at the Venetian, or are just shopping around the Grand Canal Shoppes. Probably wouldn't drive all the way here for just Sloan's, but again, it's a great option. It's tucked away in a small area of the shoppes right in front of the bridge that crosses over to the other side of the shoppes. Walk in and get in line, it forms a ""U"" shape that pretty much follows the walls of the little place, but just know that there are two registers, which can get a little confusing, esp when the lines get long, because the windows between each set of registers do not have the same exact flavors, at least not the last time I checked. A lot of options to pick from, and don't worry about the people behind, because you really should take your time and look at everything they have to offer. I've had a few flavors already, and liked them all so far; butter pecan, pistachio, mint n chip, vanilla. $5 for ice cream, which is expected 'round these parts, esp cuz of where you're at, but it's not a deal breaker. One of the last times we went, my little one opted for the Cookiewich, which from the picture on the menu on the wall doesn't look big, but i should've known once I saw that the price was $10...it's huge. They should've called it the giantwich, haha. Anyway, you can choose 3 cookies I think (I went with choc chip, so I don't even remember what the other options were), and you can choose your ice cream; she went vanilla, which was a great choice. It was pretty good, but even me at my hungriest couldn't finish that thing...prob meant to be shared with like 2 or 3 people. There are a lot of other options and even stuff to pickup while you're waiting in line, but it's all a little overwhelming and I never check it out because I typically just want ice cream and want to get back to the casino asap, hehe. Service has always been good for us, so nothing to complain about there either.

"I'm not new to 85 degrees, but wanted to share a review on to yelp! Once they've opened one in Vegas, a good majority of my money went here buying bread for my family, boba runs, and cakes for parties. -- Covid-19 review: Rules and regulations have changed since before Covid. Now that LV is in its second wave of reopening things, I've noticed that they don't regulate the amount of people who are inside the store with someone monitoring the entrance. -- Arrival: They practice social distancing with X's telling you where to stand. Each of the bread is individually wrapped and masks (just like everywhere else) are mandatory prior to entering the store. Sitting areas are closed. -- Staff: Everyone is wearing a mask and gloves. There is glass in front of the cashier to ensure social distancing rules. They're all so hardworking and make sure that the bread remains stocked. It's extremely busy with every customer grabbing more than at least 5+ items per visit. -- Menu: Their drink menu stays the same with new seasonal drinks being promoted here and there. The bread is kind of like a game of chance, you never know what's on display and there's no way to ensure you'll get a certain type of bread since it's in a first come first serve basis. -- Price: Extremely reasonable! For the amount they make everyday and the popularity of the location, I'm surprised they keep it at such a low price. Such a good reason to come back and try new items. -- FOOD: - Every food and drink is really top notch/consistent. Any location I visit, whether it's Vegas or Cali, the pastries all taste the same and rarely really misses the mark. -- Bonus: The times when you go and the bread you want is actually there, it's all worth it. -- Recommend? Go if you have the TIME to get all the delicious pastries. Don't go with an expectation to get a certain bakery item, it's most likely run out.",5,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"When I was a kid, Bill Cosby was one of America's Respected Men, believe it or not. And from the high perch of Saturday morning television, he often pontificated to the country's youth on how breakfast was the ""most important meal of the day."" For too many years, I took ""most important"" to mean ""very large."" That led to many unconfortable weekend days saddled with the results of Shoney's Breakfast Bar or some other horrible, oversized breakfast, sometimes administered in an effort to cure a hangover (but almost always exacerbating it). Having learned the error of my ways, I still think of breakfast as very important, but it's also important to keep it light. A place like Amelie's French Bakery is perfect for that. It has reasonably-sized, reasonably-priced egg sandwiches served on surprisingly decent baguettes, accompanied by very good coffee. There are plenty of great-looking pastries as well, although I didn't try those. You get to enjoy this fare in a dining area that looks like an undergrad's fantasy of classical French sophistication. I mean that in a good way: It's got a shabby-chic and comfortable appeal to it.

Sprinkles and all of the wonderful shops just opened up around February this year. I am looking forward to visiting this location again. The coffee is also a reasonable price. I loved it. The reason it is only getting 4 stars is because some of the flavors aren't as awesome as I thought they would be. The banana cupcake tasted like an overly sweet banana bread. The coconut is the best and I also enjoyed the salty caramel. I still have many flavors to try. Didn't have a chance to use the ATM, but someone else did and it took 10 minutes for the cupcake to come out. I don't know if it is suppose to take that long.

My kids ordered a scoop each of two different flavors, my hubby ordered two scoops of the caramel toffee (I can't remember the exact name) and I ordered two scoops of the honey lavender, which was delicious!! We really enjoy our ice cream. Hubs even loved his. They use real lavender flowers in the honey lavender and you can definitely taste the honey as well.

I'd definitely recommend this place and would also go here again!

"While staying at the Cosmopolitan , I was trying to stop at as many restaurants as possible and have the best LV dining experience as I could. Milk Bar is right near Egg Slut & the Juice Standard (reviews below) in the Boulevard Tower. To forewarn you, the menu is pretty extensive and a little bit difficult to navigate. I wasn't sure what I wanted - and that didn't help either. The girl at the register whose name is Lissa, helped me through the ordering process. She went through each of the things they offer and told me what the most popular items were & what her personal favorites were as well. That helped me figure out my order. I knew I wanted to do the three cookies for $10 deal and I went for the chocolate chip marshmallow cookie, the confetti cookie, and the compost cookie which is supposed to be their most popular. They also had a blueberry flavor, and a corn meal - which Lissa said was her favorite. They also had a new birthday cake flavored - scented balm they were selling. Most people use it on their lips but it's concentrated enough that you can use it on your hands as well. I love birthday cake flavored/scented anything and everything so I purchased that as well for $12. To round it all off- Lissa said that her favorite thing on the menu as well as the most popular item was the birthday cake truffles. She said hands-down you need to get that. So for an additional six dollars I purchased that as well. For $28 I got three cookies, a lip - hand balm, and the birthday cake truffles which was a set of three. I have to say, I was not a big fan of the compost cookie or the chocolate chip marshmallow cookie. The lip - hand balm was good for the lips but not great anywhere else. Wasn't the best purchase. Now-in my opinion, the confetti flavored cookie was unreal. Sugar cookie with rainbow/funfetti sprinkles inside. Also, the birthday truffles were no joke! Yum status. There was not really a long line at all when we went. In fact, every time we walked by there didn't seem like a long line. However there are always a few people there which is a good sign. It's a tad on the Las Vegas pricey side, but that's what you would expect. I did get a lot for under $30.

Still had enough interesting varieties to make it worth the drive. Don't overlook the glazed- simple but better than any we'd ever had. The kinds with lots of frosting were, as expected, a big hit.

"This place is awesome. Do they have 300 flavors with 600 toppings? No. That's probably why this place is so awesome. I need to start out with something about the lady who was working. I'm assuming she was an owner or someone else deeply involved in the whole process, and she was more than willing to fill us in on where the ingredients came from or any other details which she deemed necessary. They mostly weren't necessary but when you have someone that is that into what they are doing, you gotta have some love for it. Between the 4 of us we probably had 12 or so samples, and we did so without a bad look or skip in the record of our servers in depth guide to the flavors. I settled on the salted caramel ice cream, which was phenomenal. Silky, smooth, and buttery like a kobe bryant jump shot. Its 9AM right now and my mouth is watering thinking about it. There are so many flavors that you just generally would never see and as weird as they may seem, they all taste great. Next time in Scottsdale, theres a good chance I will hopefully be able to visit this hot spot (cool spot) again.",5,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"It's past midnight and still 90 degrees out. Cookies and ice cream sounded like the perfect snack. I'm not adventurous when it comes to ice cream because of my tree nut allergy so I had an oatmeal/sugar cookie (correction: snickerdoodle) vanilla ice cream sandwich. Both cookies were chewy, but a bit salty and didn't compliment the ice cream well. Even my friend thought I make a better cookie. The ice cream was a bit soft, but that's understandable with the Vegas heat. I will have to return to try a cupcake. They looked really good and had exotic flavors.",4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"I'm new in town and I love ice cream. I was excited to try this place because of the great reviews. I ordered a QT of Black Cherry and the Chocolate Malt with Caramel as well as the pineapple Sundae to go. The Sundae looked great, but when I got to the vanilla IceCream, it lacked the ""Vanilla"" and sugar, and tasted like creamy milk. I thought maybe I got a bad badge of vanilla IceCream. But when I finally tried the Black Cherry and the Chocolate Malt with Caramel....both were underwhelming as well. All the IceCream I ordered lacked sugar and how they're supposed to taste. The Black Cherry tasted just like the vanilla IceCream but with cherries and reddish food coloring and the chocolate malt was also lacking ""something"". I'm glad I tried this place, but I won't be back sadly. I gave it two stars because of how long I waited in line and how much I spent. It was edible and wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.",2,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

I was already stuffed from Trattoria, but I got a canoli, took 2 bites and brought it back to my hotel for after our nightly bar trip- perfect!

"I tried the macarons here when I indulged myself and got the six pack. For $17.50, I had high expectations considering Bouchon's reputation and all. Their macarons are twice the size of macarons that I've tried before so I was kind of digging that. Despite their bigger size, the taste and flavor were not compromised. The cream wasn't too sweet and the cookie part was soft and not dry. It's too bad that the pastry chef leader or team weren't there at the kiosk at the Venetian where I got these because I'd give each person a high-five for making such damn good macarons! It's a nice luxurious but expensive treat. For me, a nice reward to look forward to eat at the end of a typical crazy Vegas trip!

"Amelie's was decent but not worth the price or wait in line in my opinion. I went with my girlfriend, her mom, and my mom and was able to try a few different pastries. The salted caramel brownie was good. I really liked the brownie, and the caramel topping was okay although not really my thing. For $2.50 though, I would expect more than the tiny 1 oz brownie you get. The eclairs were decent too. I didn't really like the pastry part, but the vanilla and chocolate custards were both pretty tasty. My girlfriend and her mom were both disappointed that it was a custard filling rather than cream but enjoyed them nonetheless. I had one bite of a piece of chocolate cake and it was pretty good as well, but not anything worth $5 for a cupcake sized piece. After waiting in line for 10 minutes (it was Saturday evening, I'll give them that) and seeing the really high prices for the portions, I assumed these desserts must be heaven, but everyone in my group agreed they were just decent and nothing more.",3,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,Positive,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"I came here recently on a trip to Vegas and stopped by to check out the hype. I picked up a tin of 6 cookies as gifts ($17... $18 and change after tax) and also tried the fruity cereal milk soft serve topped with crushed corn flakes. The cereal milk soft serve tastes exactly like how you would expect it to. It was almost salty and not sweet at all. The salty taste probably came from the crushed corn flakes. Not a bad dessert, but definitely on the heavier side. I could go without this in the future. As for the cookies- tried 3: 1. Compost cookie- this cookie is a bit hard texturally and has a lot of interesting elements to it. Overall, tasted a lot like a toffee cookie to me with bits of pretzel. I give it 2-1/2 out of 5 stars. 2. Chocolate chip marshmallow cookie- 4/5- softer cookie and you definitely taste the corn flakes. I liked this one more than the compost. 3. Corn cookie- my fave and I can see why it's a cult classic. Would love to replicate this at home! 5/5!

"I was really excited to visit this famous Charlotte patisserie not only because everyone was raving about the their delicious tarts, croissants, & eclairs, but also because it's open ALL THE TIME (24hrs/day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year) and they are welcoming of all kinds of people to hangout, read, study. First off, the good: - Salted Caramel Brownie (5 stars): the PERFECT contrast of smooth sweet/salty caramel atop a thin but dense (and slightly crunchy) chocolate brownie. You must try this if you love either caramel or brownies! - Their creme brÃ»lÃ©e was delicious, and the fact that they flambÃ©/torch it only when ordered so it's warm, fresh, and crispy was a nice touch. - Finally, the chocolate eclair and mixed-berry tart were both very decent and I'd happily order them again. The only downside is that it was abundantly clear that those long hours really diminished the quality of at least 2 of their items: - The croissant: I had already ordered a few items so I wasn't planning to get anything else, but I'm a sucker for a great croissant and the lady at the counter said it was fresh baked that morning, so I happily ordered it expecting a soft, flaky, buttery snack. Unfortunately what I got was hard and dry; honestly, I've had day old croissants taste fresher than this! I have no doubt that if it were fresh out of the oven it would have been amazing, but someone definitely wasn't keeping track of how old/dry these were. - The sticky-bun (mini cinnamon roll + raisins & extra sugar glaze on top): it also was was disappointingly ""aged"" liked the croissant, and although I've got a notorious sweet tooth, this tasted way too sugary too me. Overall, I'd definitely come back for their delicious snacks/desserts that are not too perishable and to try their famous macaroons. As for the disappointing croissant, I'd be willing to try it again if I KNEW it was fresh, but otherwise skip it.",3,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"I came here for the Yelp Elite event Sunday evening. They closed the place just for us, and you could feel the tension in the air as the ""regular schmegular"" people walked up smiling, only to walk away in disgust. Oh well... I don't know if it was the fact that we were excited to try the ice cream, or that I'm sure many of us were having dessert BEFORE dinner! That NEVER happens in my world, but we all descended upon the place at once and the line was out of the door. Unfortunately, the weather did not care that we were standing outside because the rain began to pour down on us and we had to move our party inside. If you know anything about this place, it is small. So it became uncomfortable rather quickly, but as for me, I kept busy talking with a new friend from Florida and trying to narrow down my three top choices. I thought I was being proactive when I went online to look at the flavors and decide then, but the flavors were different. Just like many of the other ice cream shops, you are allowed to taste flavors before making a commitment. I tried the goat cheese with cherries and sweet corn with blackberries. In the end, I decided on the Gooey Butter cake first in the cone, followed by cream puff, and topped with goat cheese with red cherries. {Insert long, deep sigh here!} First of all, the flavors were strategically placed in the cone in a specific order because I had a feeling about that butter cake...everyone raved about it and whatever flavor is at the bottom of the cone, you get to enjoy most. See what I did there?!?! Let me just say that I live in the University City area and I would have zero problems driving over just for ice cream.

The peanut butter was very peanutty and delicious and the Irish Cream definitely meets expectations. The chocolate chip, although good, could certainly use more chips. Our only disappointment was with having such a the wide variety of flavors they didn't have chocolate.

We all maintain that it was my 4-week old niece's idea. Smart girl.

"I discovered this place when I was in Vegas, craving macarons. My first visit in early June was filled with surprise, the macaron were twice the size of a regular macaron! And, when I took my first bite, I fell in love. The macaron was crispy yet airy on the inside, and chewy filled with delicious cream in the middle. The macaron was absolutely perfect, and I had no complaints about it. However, when I visited Bouchon again this week, I was disappointed in the size of the macarons. Their macaron size now is very inconsistent, some were larger than others, and overall, the macarons had shrunk. When I ordered a box back in June, all the macarons were in perfect uniformity. Now, some were small, while other flavors were larger. I also tried the turkey sandwich, and fell in love. The bread has cranberries/raisins, and when toasted, it was a perfect complement to the turkey and brie cheese. I got this sandwich every morning and am still not sick of it. I plan on trying the other pastries when I visit Las Vegas again, but I hope that the macarons will not disappoint.

Parking can be a challenge, but we always find a way! There is only one bench seat along the side and there are milk crates in the back that can double as seats.

"Beyond disappointing. Went here the second day after they opened at 10 am there doors were shut. Went again an hour later the doors were still shut. Went to concierge and they called them and they lied to concierge saying they've been open since 10. We came back today 1/7/17 a few days. We ordered the deal sampler thing, a coffee milk shake, and the birthday quake. We were trying to get a quick treat before having to walk over to bellagio for o and wanted to get free parking at cosmo while it lasted. We had 45 min, which we thought was plenty of time. No one was in line and 3 shakes were ordered before us (they obviously got there things before us and we saw). There had to be about 7-10 people on staff there. Only 1 person was making orders, everyone else was chatting in front of the register while this poor girl is struggling to make these orders. We were given the cookies and truffles and pie at the register so we had those but had to wait 25 minutes to get our milk shake and quake. Then had to remind them to give us our soft serve which they made ever so slowly. it was ice cream and cornflakes. We weren't sure why it took so long but we went with it. The compost cookie was terrible. I like pretzels and stuff, but it just tried too hard. The crack pie is def overrated. I would prefer the pecans. The lady described it like a pecan pie without pecans, I wasn't paying attention so i got excited for pecans to realize she said without them. that's my b,. The birthday truffle was too sweet for me. The birthday quake had an off taste that i wasn't a fan of and the coffee milkshake wasn't sweet enough oddly. We then were out 60 bucks and didn't like anything. So we went back with the milk shake hopping they would remake us something else. We asked what they recommended and we got a chocolate shake. Can't go wrong with that. We then realized we jinxed it. It was bitter and not sweet, so we tossed it in a garbage and left. I love the cosmo hotel, but there not putting good things in place of the old, and the prices are just highway robbery.

I went on a hot summer day, and even though there was a line, it wasn't too bad. The servers are all very friendly and I got to try many of their flavors. I loved the salted butter caramel and the sweet corn. I'm excited to try the next season's flavors!! I was not disappointed by any of them and agreed that the ice cream was certainly some of the best! They have a nice sitting area equipped with board games and cards. Very clean and inviting! This is by far my new favorite ice cream shop in Arizona! :)",5,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown
"We are a fan of the show and have always wanted to go to their main store, but when my daughter and I heard about the shop on the strip we had to go. Their selection is not large, but what they do have is very good. My daughter and go the lobster tails and HOLY COW they were amazing. The next day (Sunday) we arrived early so we could get some goodies for the family, but they did not have any Cannolis. We got some more lobster tails, biscotti and White Chocolate Mouse Cake. My wife was very happy with the cake and my other daughter was disappointed they did not have any Connolis, but was very happy with the lobster tail.",4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"This is ice cream at its best. You can tell that this comes from homemade recipes and you can tell that it's fresh and just delicious. The scoops are very generous so one scoop, in a cup or in a waffle bowl, is a lot bigger than I would expect. I got the black cherry scoop of ice cream in a waffle bowl. The ice cream was the best I have ever had for black cherry ice cream, no contest. The waffle bowl is freshly made on the premises and it was absolutely yummy. My friend got the bananas Foster ice cream and was pretty much in heaven. We got our son the chocoholic ice cream and it was amazing as well. We got lucky when we got there because there were only two people ahead of us. The lines tend to get long at times. We initially saw this place in California and the line to get the ice cream was around the building so we were excited to find one near us in Las Vegas. When we started ordering our ice cream, we noticed at least 20 people behind us. This is no surprise because the quality of the ice cream and the cones are incredible. The prices are right and I highly recommend it. We are definitely going back.",5,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive
"The atmosphere alone is worth 4 stars for me. And the croissant was good enough for me to keep trying with the food. What I loved - the atmosphere, the staff, the coffee (please, will the people who are falling to pieces about no skim or 2% just go to Starbucks and stop taking up space and breathing my full-fat air), my ham and cheese breakfast croissant, the mini-fruit tart. What I liked - the salted caramel brownie, which in no way resembles a brownie, but is very sweet and satisfying. I still have a small chocolate mousse waiting for sampling, and am just gonna give it the benefit of the doubt. What I didn't like - the rest of the pastry selection I sampled really suffered (but I'm a fighter, and I am gonna keep trying!!). The cream puff was several days old, it might have been better had in made recently but the one I had was quite stale. The same problem with the cherry turnover, I think this would be very nice if it had been fresh. But I won't order this one again. The chocolate croissant was just unfortunate. Whomever had made the croissant, or maybe served it, had been working with asiago cheese previously. So my chocolate croissant had a very distinct asiago cheese flavor - not good, not good at all. We were there at 9:00 on a Sunday - i would expect Saturday to be the biggest baking day, so maybe we were there early enough that they were clearing out the old stuff before stocking the newly baked goods.

We waited in line for about 25 minutes and was truly disappointed. We got: One yellow cupcake with buttercream - cake was dry and frosting was flavorless. One cream puff - The cream inside was once again flavorless and tasted like overcooked eggs. The pastry part was not flakey at all. One cup of strawberry shortcake - Besides the strawberry, I toss the cup away. The cake was once again dry and the whipped cream was flat. A sprinkle cookie - It was okay. Nothing worth the half hour wait. We tossed most of the items away, since it so bland. If you're going to eat something bad for your health, every bite better be worth it! This was not worth it. It's also overpriced and overcrowded, yet sadly the pastries are underachieved.",2,Negative,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown
"Are you kidding me? Where has this place been all my life? While visiting Cleveland for the weekend, my son and I decided to trek downtown so check out its 'renaissance' and we weren't disappointed. We decided to catch the sunset and city view from Edgewater Park and then opted to have dessert before heading back to the hotel. A quick search of the area suggested Mitchell's so we headed over. Love the area it's in (Market Square, near as I can tell) and the marquis out front. From the street, you can easily see you're in for a treat as it's bright, open and airy; an old-school ice cream parlor feel but with a modern vibe. Fortunately there was a small, but fast moving line when we entered. Being novices, we were happy to find a menu near the door so we could be prepared when we hit the counter (Seinfeld 'Soup Nazi' episode came to mind). Instead, the staff was all so happy and helpful and we decided on a waffle cone with a scoop of salted caramel and Mint chip. Yum Yum and Yum again. We discovered my son doesn't care for the former but we both the loved the latter. So creamy, perfectly minted and with magical chunks of chocolate. I found pricing reasonable at $6.50 for the portion size. The creamery is set up pretty neat with a large window behind the counter though which you can watch the kitchen in action (it was late so there wasn't much going at the time) but it's worth the trip upstairs for the birds eye view. I can't imagine going anywhere else for ice cream while in Cleveland. And from what I could tell, their flavors rotate and there are alway plenty of choices. Don't miss this spot!!",5,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive
"ooooooooo how delicious their cupcakes were!!!!!!! This place has a variety of choices for cupcakes and it is so worth to try it out! The promenade one even has a little cupcake ATM right outside of it in case you miss their operating hours or the line for the store is crowded for you. It only takes credit card, but during their hours you can go inside and go into the cupcake or ice cream area. They had plenty of people working the Sprinkles shop and didn't laugh when I went in the wrong area initially lol. I had the chocolate chip cookie cupcake and my mom had the coconut cupcake! The presentation in itself is marvelous and the way they package their items are so nice! And lastly, we loved the taste of the ones we got and almost snagged another available at the McCarran airport before we left for Cleveland.

Perfectly baked. Perfectly flakey yet soft. The croissant had the right amount of ""bite"" to it. I have no negative comments about taste, staff, decor. I am glad they were able to move into a bigger location in the same neighborhood, though I do miss the smaller more intimate feel as now it has more of a mass-market kitchen feel to it. We were greeted when we walked in and quickly asked how they could help us. Help me?

Birthday Cake could be a little bit ""too sweet"" for some but to me it was more rich than sweet. The Crack PIe is the business. If you freeze it it's even better. Again very rich and flavorful and a cross between pecan pie and peanut brittle (without the nuts) but it's one of those things where the whole pie is in front of you and 10 mins later you look down and nothing is there cause your fat ass ate the whole damn thing without realizing it. It's that good imo.

Prices aren't cheap, about $3.50 for a scoop. It was a nice scoop, and you can even say a generous scoop, but its still one scoop of ice cream. Was it the best ice cream I've ever had? Hmm, not sure.

"When Fatty Daddy's opened up, this place was really great. The main attractions were the Fatty Daddy or Mini Daddy cookie cups, but the ambiance and staff were amazing too. We went in the other night after not visiting in awhile and things felt... off. Cookie cup? Is that the same thing we used to get? I thought there were two sizes. My friend orders a cookie cup, but they only give him half a cookie and a smaller portion of ice cream than normal. The girl behind the counter was friendly, but seemed a little nervous. We asked where the amazing Steve Urkel picture went, and the girl explained the business is under new ownership. This explains everything. Even the POS system is different, and doesn't offer rewards or incentives. I even got a flier for Fatty Daddy's this week advertising ""Coffee, pastries, and ice cream, Relax, refresh, recharge!"" It's an ice cream spot, not a day spa. Say ""Ice cream, coffee, pastries"" at least- your name has the word Fatty in it... priorities people. Anyway. This spot is worth looking for and worth the trip. The ice cream flavors are a solid mix of classics and unique blends. If you've never been here before, you won't know the difference and it'll probably be a 5 star place for you. But I feel new management may have cut out some of the charm and is trying to skimp on things that made us come back for more.",1,unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"This place is just ok at best. I've had Sprinkles cupcakes before and wasn't crazy about them, but I wanted to try their ice cream anyway. I opted for a scoop of their salted caramel ice cream in a cup. I was warned by the guy at the counter that it was very salty. I asked for a taste and did find it on the salty side, so I asked for caramel sauce to make it sweeter and more caramel-y. The ice cream was ok - not terrible but not among the best I've had either. As for the caramel sauce, it was on the runnier side and I prefer it thick and more flavorful. There is plenty of seating outside but it was just too hot to sit out there on the day we went. Luckily there was counter seating on the cupcake side of the shop. (Ice cream is to the right when you enter; cupcakes to the left.) We had to wipe the counter top though - there were crumbs galore on it. It made no sense to me that they had a bunch of workers waiting to help on the cupcake side (most were not helping customers as there was a lull in foot traffic) and not one of them could wipe down the counter top. We returned later in the day with a friend who wanted to try their cupcake ATM, but it was out of service. This is one of those places where I can say that I'm glad that I tried it, but I don't feel the need to come back.",2,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown

Oh boy, it was 9am and there was already a long line waiting to place orders. Thank goodness they have a system of taking orders while you're in line so that you get your order and pay for it by the time you get to the cashier around the corner. Unfortunately, as I found out, when you place your order from around the corner, unless you already know what's being displayed at the front of the counter, you will only have seen the several awesomely delicious looking pastries on display......and likely have missed everything else at the front counter display around the corner. There were a few more items such as cookies, breakfast croissant and French baguette sandwiches, yoghurt, mixed fruit cups, etc. Yea, I could've added the items to my order, but it was so busy and I didn't want to get dirty looks from the customers in line behind me....plus everybody behind he counter was so busy that I didn't want to bother them......plus, I had already ordered more than enough. I ordered one raisin danish (ok, they called it something raisin in French, but I forget the name and spelling) and a blueberry muffin. Yes, they were both totally fresh and yummy! However, the raisin pastry I thought was a bit thin so you don't get the full usual fluffiness of the inside.....the outer crisp was nice and light though.

"This place had amazing reviews, and photos on Yelp looked amazing so we came out here for post-dinner dessert. I loved what I got, but was not overly impressed. So you can make your own bowl here meaning you pick your 2 flavors of gelato, your choice of macaroon, one topping, and they add on a fired roasted marshmallow on top. They had some AWESOME gelato flavors. I had the chocolate malt and the mango habanero. Let me jus say... Ive had ice cream with a kick before, but nothing like this mango habanero. It was SPICY, and I got the malt flavor (which was amazing) to neutralize it essentially. They obviously don't compliment each other, but the malt was good to switch to when my tongue needed a break from the habanero. Anyway, this place is a 4/5 and not a 5/5 because I just didn't feel like the macaroons were fresh or that good. I asked for the red velvet macaroon and I wasn't sure if they accidentally gave me the strawberry one. Regardless, it was alright. I think the macaroons overall here are underwhelming. The ice cream total was around $7 which I was OK with for the experience. Anyway, for the 'gram this place is great. And for kids! If you want an exotic, crazy colored macaroon like you see in some of the Yelp photos, they may not have those/didn't when we went. By the way, they do also have bubble tea! I didn't try any when I went, but there were some limited options on the menu. There are a few tables and it was pretty empty when we went on a Friday night!

The turkey sandwich comes with cheddar(?), onion, and watercress on pecan bread. It was ok - you can tell the ingredients are good - but the sandwich itself wasn't outstanding. Most of the items seem to just miss the mark: the bacon(?), egg, and cheese croissant comes with a beautiful, fat slice of omelet but it's topped with a thin sliver of cheese; the Cobb salad is huge but bacon wasn't listed as an ingredient so I passed on that.

My boyfriend ordered a chocolate malt & received a vanilla one. If you decide to try it out (which I would advise against with so many better ice cream or gelato shops in the valley) ask for it ""to go"" as seating is limited.",1,Negative,Negative,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"This ice cream place is a cute store! Has so many toys and interesting things. I like the interior design in the store. The Vietnamese coffee tastes pretty good. But I ended up getting the strawberry ice cream. Their ice cream is really creamy and soft. Also, their scoops are so big! I couldn't finish one by myself. They had extra seating outside in the back with the water misters going on so that was nice. I was scared I was going to eat my ice cream in the heat because there is no inside seating. Only one thing I didn't like is how the ice cream was melting really quick. Its probably from the combination of the door being kept open and people were really crowded in that store. I also don't see why people like this place so much. It's okay. Nothing special to it just regular ice cream but I just went to try to say that I have gone there before.",3,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive
"What an awesome ice cream eatery! Had the Mini Daddy cookie cup with mango and passion fruit sorbet, and topped it off with an almond macaroon. All cookie cups come with a toasted marshmallow. It was delicious! My husband had a Nutella and Java milkshake, and really enjoyed his drink as well. The interior was clean and super cute. This 80s baby loved the Steve Urkel painting on the wall. Jackson 5 songs were playing over the speakers, so it was a fun throwback atmosphere. The server who helped us was very polite, and encouraged us to try all their fun flavors, like the Urkel (chocolate and peanut butter) and Netflix and Chill (vanilla with popcorn and chocolate candy).

"Overhyped and underwhelming. Unlike other yelpers, the line wasn't terribly long and moved quickly. They had a plethora of options to choose from, all of which looked good. However, the cupcakes themselves were disappointing. The cake was relatively dry and lacked flavor. At nearly $5 a piece, I've experienced better at most other bakeries selling for the same price.

Now they have no indoor area to sit so that leaves just a couple of benches outside ( no tables ) as many of the other places in town have. If you have little ones I would get it to go. Their ice cream was ok but not worth the drive as I noticed on their signage.

Ill def be back to try other things and they also have a lot of old school cans y unused to eat when I was younger. I never really see them at stores anymore. Also the place is clean and the bathrooms are nice. Nice place to sit in the back by all the hipster bikes. Valet is free which is nice but I wish we could just park ourselves.

"Quaint little donut shop starring astonishingly flavorful donuts, paired with a small variety of hot and iced coffees. French Toast donut comes with berry jelly, butter and what I thought to be real maple syrup! If it wasn't 100% maple, it sure was great quality! I don't know if it was the customer service or the high-quality ingredients that was the most impressionable! Those who love coffee will understand this next statement....It was a bad coffee weekend until I tried the Portland Roast at The Donut Bar! Starbucks couldn't even hold their own this weekend.

Like when I first heard of it I didn't know what to expect, but when I had it, it literally tasted like the milk you'd have right after you finish eating all the cereal in the bowl. Haha I was so happy because I haven't had that taste in my mouth for a while. It was the perfect amount of sweetness (not too sweet which was perfect, like I didn't want to throw it away I just kept going at it) and I bought it with the corn flakes, so the crunch added texture and made it so pleasant to eat! I'm craving this right now tbh, which is why it has taking me so long to give a review, Staff members were super informative and sweet when I was there. So at that time service was 5/5 :)",5,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

This is your classic ice cream shop and one of the best in the Burgh! Even though it is only soft serve (all homemade with plenty of flavors) don't let that stop you from visiting. The menu is extensive with every kind of sundae and Arctic swirl combo you could imagine. The cookie crumb arctic swirl with Nancy B's chocolate chip cookies is one of my favorites. Also their fall menu with pumpkin ice cream is amazing! I highly recommend the pumpkin roll arctic swirl topped with a homemade pumpkin roll. The parking here is a bit tricky (gravel lot under a bridge) and no seating (outdoor counter only) but absolutely worth the stop and wait (can be long lines on the weekends).,5,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive

The lobster tail would have been better if it wasn't so darn hard. It was difficult to even take a bite it was so hard. Had good flavor but I threw most of it out. $10 down the drain. Also, as we were waiting for our items to be bagged up we noticed that the kitchen was a disaster. Maybe they shouldn't have windows.

"This is a cute little ice cream shop for atmosphere, but the actual ice cream was kind of just 'ok'. The waffle cone, in particular, was almost inedible from the amount of salt in it. Also, because I have pins in my ankle from a motorcycle accident, I generally like to sit down when I go out to eat, and there wasn't any place to sit comfortably. There are two small benches right outside the shop, but they were right in the blasting sun; the tables outside are for the neighboring coffee shop. So, I wound up walking over to the other side of the street and sitting on the curb in the shade. It was alright for that one time, but I probably won't visit again.",3,Negative,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

I have know idea what to do if life gives you lemons, but when life gives you Sprinkles Cupcakes, you eat them. You eat them now! I got a classic (and old-timey Sprinkles favorite) Red Velvet Cupcake with Cream Cheese Frosting and the iconic sprinkles dot. I was satisfied. Life was good. So, I got another Sprinkles cupcake, but this time a traditional Black & White Cupcake featuring Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Frosting. Mmmm...life was still good.

"Once you're inside the West Side Market, I know how it can be if you don't have a game plan. You have long lines, big decisions to make with vendors, and a need to shop with purpose before the lines get longer. So where do you go first? Let me make it easy: CrÃªpes De Luxe. I hear people get a little salty that the staff doesn't always come off as sunshine and rainbows. Um, hi! These saints are making hundreds of crepes per day and taking ultra picky requests from visitors, all while shouting over loud noises and trying to provide fast service. I'm normally not a fan of savory crepes, but both the savory and sweet options are superb. The Le Roi (bananas, peanut butter and chocolate) and the Florence (spinach, egg and gruyere cheese) are my favorite odd combo to get together. I don't normally stick around to eat it (I shop with purpose!), so I get it to-go. While they may not always say it explicitly, you can get a box! Just ask and they'll pack it up for you. Be advised: there's a line and its a slow process! Every crepe is handmade. You are waiting for quality, and its worth every second for these flavorful crepes.

Very whimsical and colorful store interior with lots to look at and distract yourself from the large array of ice cream flavors and toppings. There is also a small confectionery corner with lots of different brownies and chocolates (kidneys couldn't handle that extra amount of sugar this time...) I got the classic sundae which comes with 3 scoops and topping of choice, liquid and one sprinkles choice costs $10.99. It's a good choice and the sampler is more than double and you get 9 scoops. The ice flavors are tempting and decadent. I chose birthday, mixed berry stracciatelli, and mom's apple pie. My favorites were the mom's apple pie and the mixed berry.

We didn't have a chance to try one, but they looked delicious and we were told good for sharing. They even have a family sundae for $38! When you walk in, they gave us a free peppermint sample. The right of the shop is the chocolate. You can buy in bulk for just under $10 for half a pound, so pricey. But you can pick and choose what types you want, and so many good ones to choose from. There are also small bags of one kind of chocolates and if you buy 4 bags, you get a deal but still more expensive than buying the mini chocolate bags at Walgreens. I couldn't resist the hot chocolate pouches for 3/$12, I hope it tastes as good as the packaging looks. If you are looking for gifts, there are tins with assorted chocolates. Since we couldn't decide from all the different types, we got the big bag of 80 chocolates (more than 2lbs worth) for $27. There was a deal if you buy 2 bags, you get $5 off. These big bags come in a variety of bags, including mixed and Christmas chocolates. The staff were very helpful to tell us about the differing bags, and various products.

And, the macarons are huge! The size was unlike any others I've had, but they were still the perfect consistency. If you're on the strip and looking for a spot to grab a light breakfast, or a quick bakery snack, I think Bouchon Bakery is a great place to do it!

I made a decision to order the brownie that looked killer to nibble on later in the day, they warmed it and it was devoured before we even left. Very rich! There was a island of the mini packets of Ghirardelli that you can grab a bag and fill with the different flavors you want to try, as well as already packed bags. There was several employees walking around giving samples of these mini squares. There was a cute little ornament they were selling and the employee told me they were selling a bag with a full bar of the peppermint chocolate flavor for the same price. Side note: I have to make so much effort to not gain $30 lbs because this is my favorite flavor! We ended up leaving with so much free chocolate!

"Strawberry-jalapeno ice cream! The color was pink as expected, with a summer-strawberry aroma. The first taste was fruit-forward, all strawberry with a full-bodied creamy mouth-feel. Then the quick bite of jalapeno hit, just enough to be fully spicy, but not so much as to burn and grab for water. A great ice cream starts in the kitchen, and this chef's passion for the craft played out in my waffle cone. All kidding aside, these guys can make ice cream!

"When you take on an establishment like ice cream you better have a damn good idea. Rolling out a dozen deviations of chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry flavor X may work for a summer time smash and grab shop but if your going to thrive and ultimately shatter perspective you have to have an ice cream flavor renaissance. Like bacon... or sweet corn.... or rosemary..... or a mojito recipe When I first heard of bacon flavored ice cream, I was utterly horrified, this sounds like some fiendish experiment played out by a fictional madman like Dr. Frankenstein. But still I'll try anything once and pay my cardiologist to worry about it later. I can't possibly warn you enough, it's like crack, who knew.... But enough about my impending doom. Sweet Republic truly soars above the competition, the innovation and product quality are simply outstanding. We have gone back numerous times and never been disappointed. The staff is excellent, the decco is dynamic, and of course the ice cream is world class.

Looking for good ice cream late Saturday night found this place on yelp. This little red building is tucked away off Grand and 10th dont blink you'll miss it. OMG what a find! Best ice cream I've had. You can tell they are homemade with passion. The flavors were old time favorites like chocolate and artisan flavors like fat Elvis wow. I had butter beer hubby had toffee burbon crunch yummy. Ice cream in a donut really it's perfect. The owners Brandon and Jennifer love what they do they told us the how the business started and what goes into their ice creams. You can tell they have a real passion and it shows In their product.

Of course, eating the delicious ice cream all the way down to the bottom was not too much of a problem for my friend, and the lack of banana was verified. And I had to ask for a drink of water three times: each time I was given a smile and told I would have a small cup of water right away....and waited at the counter...and waited.

"Rating 3.5 TLDR: If youre looking for halo-halo, come here. However, don't be too surprised, it tastes like any other halo-halo. So, its really up to what youre craving. Please keep in mind, this rating is based solely off my order halo halo, and not a rating for their other desserts. Not TLDR: Its been a while since I've had some Filipino dessert; specifically halo-halo. Where I live now, there isnt halo halo. So, when I found out that this place had this, my wife and I had to check it out. We drove from Tempe to this little hole in the wall, and it was the perfect time for desserts since it was still pretty warm. We arrived, and got their signature dessert: halo halo. It was good, but nothing amazing. It did satisfy both our cravings though. The service was impeccable, and the other desserts looked great. However, I have to give it 3.5 stars for their most reviewed item; which left me unimpressed. Based on other reviews, I have no doubt the other desserts are good.

Not the best pain au chocolat I have had. It was not very flaky and seemed a little empty inside because there wasn't much layers from the dough. Could have used more chocolate filling too. But the beignet was good! The dough itself was not too sweet given the filling was. Too bad I didn't see any bread or brioche at this location or else I would have gotten it.

"There's more to this place than bakery. To be honest, I prefer the other bakery in Little Italy as far as sweets. But I will say this... Presti's has THE BEST Coconut Macaroon on the planet. I go there just to get those alone. They are huge, crusty on the outside, soft and delicate on the inside and half dipped in dark chocolate. Be sure not to put these babies in plastic though, they are best when the outside is crusty. Best to eat them as soon as you get them! There are some other notable baked goods, like the brownie cookie, the soft biscotti cookies, anise cookies and the higher end stuff in the far case like tiramisu and iced brownies. They also make a killer cappuccino. Now here is where Presti's shines... they've got tons of good food and their space is super cozy. Whenever I come home and don't feel like cooking, I head over to Presti's for some takeout. I love the chicken picatta and marsala, the clam linguini, the various other pasta dishes. Their cold salads like egg, potato and chicken salad taste like you made it at home. There's this polenta bake that I absolutely LOVE. The pizza is pretty decent, although I usually end up throwing on more cheese. At breakfast time, they have great croissant sandwiches. Generally, the food is very good and reasonably priced. There's a lot to choose from and the offerings aren't always the same. Presti's is a great place to sit and hang. The inside is warm and inviting and the outside seating is great. They are in the perfect location. You can enjoy free Wi-Fi as well. You will always find a bunch of locals on laptops. Be sure to take a number if need be.

"Can not for the life of me figure out what the hype is all about! Disgusting abominations of sugar on top of sugar, dense bready thick, dry, stupidly huge, so called donuts. Husband went downtown early sat to get some to try since we heard about the place being so great and that they ""sell out"". Yeah ok. All first timers or tourists and not repeat customers I'd be sure! 2 days later and they are still sitting on my counter, most untouched, after we ""tried"" a tasting of a few of them..... And I have a house full of kids, one of which is a teenage boy, if that tells you anything! If they won't eat it you KNOW it's bad! Lol! The cream brÃ»lÃ©e (best seller!?! Ugh!) was disgusting. Tasteless hard coating of topping that sticks in your teeth on top of basically bread with literally a teaspoon amount of supposed Bavarian creme (also not made fresh, definitely out of a can). Ick! Every one we tried had the exact same tasteless dense dense dense bread like dough. I would compare it very much like the French bread loaves you get at Walmart for $1 topped or filled with multiple variations of whatever disgusting sugar concoction you can think of. Frosting (any of them) is nothing special and entirely pointlessly overdone, tastes like store bought in the cake isle. Apple tart topped with bacon one was dry (as were all of them due to the ""bread"" dough they use). I'm not sure how in the world you can make an apple filling tasteless but they did it! Dumped straight out of a can. Super disappointed since that one looked the most promising. The pop tart one... Well that is one that is still sitting untouched on the counter. Just grossly huge, pop tart wrapped in bread, filled with some sort of sickly sweet jelly, and topped with more sugar type topping. Oh! And sprinkles! Puke! My kids wouldn't even touch it. There is also a sponge bob one so decorated with the gross frosting that my 7 yr old didn't event attempt it. Basically it is clear that the object of this place is to make things ""look"" interesting enough to buy but absolutely no attention to actual taste, quality or ingredients. Nothing even remotely tastes like it was hand made fresh. Everything is ingredients you can buy in the cake isle (and bread isle) at the grocery store and make yourself. Blagh!

"Sweet Republic is a haven for frozen treat fiends. It is definitely one of the best ice cream parlors in the Valley, and according to the Food Network, creates one the Best Things I Ever Ate: Toffee Banofi sundae. Um, yes, I concur. I try to get a weekly sweet treat from Sweet Republic, and I am working on branching out from my favorite flavors to try all of their amazing creations. The Bananas Foster ice cream is just fantastic - sweet, subtle flavor of banana in ice cream form. I do not usually care for banana-flavored foods, but this is just so tasty. Of course, I also LOVE the Salted Butter Caramel, the Madagascar Vanilla, and Belgian Chocolate. The sorbet flavors are outstanding - for a huge pick me up, try the Basil Lime; for just fruity deliciousness, get the Coconut and Strawberry. Sweet Republic also does interesting flavor rotations, including Honey Blue Cheese, Bacon, White Truffle, and other holiday themed flavors. You could try a different flavor every week! Sweet Republic also has a menu full of amazing sundaes and ice cream creations. I love the ice cream sandwiches - my favorite flavor between two chocolate chip cookies - what could be better!? Now, be warned that Sweet Republic is not to be considered inexpensive. They have small servings and they aren't cheap.

It was the perfect sweet treat for a late night. They offer lots of sandwiches and soups as well, but I had already had dinner... I can't recommend this place enough!!

"Items Selected: Carrot Cake Cupcake with Cream Cheese Frosting Bourbon Pecan and Salted Caramel Danish Strawberries and Cream Buttercake Monkey Bread Almond Croissant Located at 1402 Williamson Street and as such a logical follow-up to breakfast at Lazy Janes it was a short walk in the sun to Batch Bakehouse and with a selection of pastries even more sizable than the place I'd just been it was with much hemming-and-hawing that selections were made, another five pastries joining leftovers from Lazy Janes in a smorgasbord of sweets to be consumed throughout the course of the day. Trending far more artisan than its nearby neighbor with French techniques infusing classics from the American cookbook and the bakers themselves acting as servers it was only after several questions that I eventually settled on an order far smaller than I should have liked and beginning my tasting at the small countertop with a moist carrot cake topped in tangy cream cheese I knew right away that none of this one was leaving the store - a similar sentiment shared by later samples, though each was indeed eaten only in part with the rest saved for a later day snack. Moving from cupcake to the only item that would prove the least bit dull, suffice it to say that monkey bread is found better elsewhere, but moving on to arching layers not the least bit burdened by frangipane beneath a shattering shell I'd be really surprised if a better almond croissant can be found in town. Admittedly a bit sugar-saturated at this point it was onward to the dense butter cake that I progressed and, although enthusiasts from the Show Me State may claim the rounded muffin to be unauthentic, the creamy texture was divine - a similar superlative soon to be lavished on the buttery Danish with flavors both savory and sweet to spare, a light smokiness from the baked bourbon tickling the palate as candied pecans crunched with each bite.",4,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Wonderful little ice cream/candy joint right next to the Windsor Restaurant. The interior isn't very large, but it's super inviting and has a very clean/kiddish vibe to it. I think it's the perfect atmosphere for a candy/ice cream joint! They do have a wonderful back patio that is right next to the Windsor patio, but is still separate from it. The patio is very clean and inviting. There are plenty of beautiful flowers and trees to enjoy while eating your meal. The seating and shading are comfy and there are misters to keep you cool. Their menu of ice cream is not very large, but the flavors are unique and are created daily. There are plenty of topping options as well. They have a wide selection of coffees (lattes, cappuccinos, teas, Americanos, etc), as well as toppers to include Soy Milk! I ordered an Iced Americano (12oz for 2$), and my husband ordered an ice cream sandwich. You can choose to create your own sandwich using any of their delicious cookies and ice cream options. They have waffle cones, pretzel cones, and a variety of other options to pair with your ice cream experience. Unfortunately, they do not serve yogurt or sorbet ice cream at this time, a deal breaker for those of us who can't/won't eat dairy!

"For the winter, it's a ramen shop! They've had multiple ramen pop-ups in the past couple of years but I've never been able to come, so I was very excited to try it. Came with a friend on a Thursday night, pretty limited seating, so we had to wait for a little bit. There's a bar with 8 seats or so, and a 4 or 5 small tables set up. They had a tonkotsu, chicken shio, and vegetarian option for ramen. Of course we both had the tonkotsu. I was actually super impressed with the tonkotsu ramen, considering this is Cleveland (haha sorry not sorry). The broth was perfect, rich and savory and meaty, without being too salty or greasy. The tonkotsu ramen came with a piece of Charsiu, marinated soft boiled egg, corn, seaweed, enoki mushrooms and green onion. The ramen noodles were nice and chewy. The Charsiu was so tender and melt-in-your-mouth. The egg was a perfect soft boil and so flavorful! Everything was what I was looking for (but afraid to expect) in a ramen. And I didn't even feel bloated afterwards! Wish there was a little more meat though. There was a chili oil and a chili flake/powder (w cumin, Sichuan peppercorn, salt) that you could add to the ramen. I liked that it wasn't super spicy, so you could get a lot of flavor without burning your mouth. I added both to my ramen. My friend also got the iced tea, which comes in a huge glass bottle, and you get to keep the bottle! I didn't try it because I was feeling sick, but she enjoyed it.

"I definitely love this bakery, but I give it only 4 star because on my recent trip here. When I went it was extremely busy, both the cafe and the line to pick up pastries. The first issue upon arriving was that there were no more trays to pick out pastries and we had to wait about 10 minutes for someone to bring out more. Next, I tried ordering a cake on the Kiosk in the front because I assumed it'd be the fastest way. On the Kiosk, it displayed that most of the cakes were sold out so I just settled for one that was available. Although once I got to the cake case, I saw that they had all the flavors still available. Once I got to the cashier they were able to give me the cake a wanted instead, without troubles. Despite this, I hope they work on keeping the Kiosk more updated.

Great concept of a two-story ice cream shop in their ice cream factory. The ice cream certainly tastes homemade and the flavors they come up with are always worth a try.

"Rewind is a matcha specialty cafe which I was really excited to try. I have been here for both ice cream and boba drinks. They have both soft serve and hard scoop artisanal varieties. I ordered the Matcha Madness soft serve which came with chocolate shavings and picky sticks. I found the matcha flavor to be bland unfortunately. The hard scoop ice creams are not available in matcha flavor. On to the drinks, I ordered the strawberry matcha latte at the recommended 75% sweetness. The matcha flavoring was quite prominent, I was very happy with my choice. I would like to try the Matcha Americano next. I also had the Butterfly Strawberry Lemonade. Its colors were so beautiful I hesitated to mix it up but alas, must move forward. This drink is pretty unique in that none of the flavors are distinctive.

"It's unclear if this is a temporary location: vinyl banner instead of a real sign outside, only one wall decorated (everything else is painted very bare white), strangely mismatched light wooden trash can, nothing displayed in the glass case... Don't expect to be offered samples like the local artisan ice cream or gelato shops (or even Baskin Robbins), as there is no ice cream on display and employees won't offer. I was greeted with ""For here or to go?"" which better suits a place with prices that are half of what this shop is charging. For some reason they were playing awful ""screaming for singing"" with electric guitar music. While I'm not expecting old-school soda shoppe/diner music, this was awful. Minus 1 star. $6.75 after tax+$1 for tip = almost $8 for my ""20 oz"" (cup size, not really that much soda, due to foam and overflow) float. Very overpriced (minus the second star), considering the ice cream did not have a pronounced vanilla flavor (was more ""grocery store"" vanilla as opposed to a French or Vanilla Bean flavor) and had a somewhat icy texture. It was ""okay"" and the root beer itself was a drinkable chilled temperature. The worker brought the root beer float out with the styrofoam to-go cup covered completely with streams of overflowing soda (minus a third star). Obviously he had not wiped it down and replied with ""there are napkins on your table"" when I discretely asked for napkins while pointing to the big mess. The young man did apologize after I had thoroughly wiped down the cup, removed the lid which was causing the overflow, and wiped it down again. The correct ""good customer service"" response should have been to quickly realize the mistake (it never should have happened in the first place), acknowledge it, apologize, and wipe down the cup with a clean, wet cloth while offering to ""top up"" the root beer in the float. I don't think these young, new employees have been trained or empowered to give excellent customer service though. A big problem is (I assume as I didn't get one) they don't have domed lids, so the shake's froth gets all over when they smash down the ice cream with a normal flat soda lid. I'm sure it would be even more horrific with whipped cream and a cherry. Please use domed lids! I am not giving them one star as they're local and still probably in the stage of figuring things out, and my float wasn't bad after all. I appreciate that the young man apologized for the messy cup, but it was ""too little, too late."" I do not see myself coming back, due to the high price, mediocre quality, and untrained customer service.",2,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

We could've probably gotten our own because they tasted so good, but we definitely would've been overly full because they are quite big! I like the set-up of the outdoor seating area because they have plenty of room, and I think we may have snagged a seat if it weren't so hot out ;) we opted to eat in the car only for that reason!

"Had read about this place last time I was in Phoenix and we happened to be in the Scottsdale area so decided to stop in. Had a line at 2:30pm, but moved pretty quickly. Seating is limited, but they do have a few tables outside. Also saw some board games coming out of line by the restrooms if you just want to chill for awhile. They have some ""awards"" on the wall while you are waiting to order with the menu placed behind them and the special on a small board on the counter. They will offer samples of you ask, but didn't seem overly friendly about it. Now to the Ice Cream, everyone enjoyed their choices with the possible exception of the Real Mint Chip. Found you either loved it or hated it. The Salted Caramel was a hit as was the Belgian Chocolate.

"One of the best ice cream I've ever had. Can't remember the full names but on the two times I came here I ordered bourbon, strawberry (not the original strawberry) and taro coconut and all were so amazing. I even sampled multiple other flavors such as honey lavender, the peanut butter one, cookie and more. The ice cream is rich and creamy without being too overpowering. I also tried their Donut sandwhich and I really liked their donut as well. It was a pretty light donut so it complimented the ice cream very well, but I prefer just getting a cone or cup. The service was quick and incredible. I sampled almost all the flavors before choosing the flavors I wanted to order and although they were a little busy they did not seem to mind at all. 10/10 highly recommend this place, so delicious!",5,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown

"This bakery is probably the best place we ate at while in Charlotte. It's cute, modern, chic and they sell great pastries. The dÃ©cor is nice (we ate in some kind of atrium, a covered outdoor area, didn't love it), I'd recommend eating in the actual cafÃ©, there's plenty to look at it (cool furniture, artwork, etc) and they play cool music. Service is nice, we got some lunch here, a few tartines (European style open sandwich, just one baguette slice on the bottom), mine (vegetarian) with pesto, mozarella and tomatoes (I got half), my husband got the full tartine - the ham and Gruyere cheese one. They weren't as good as the ones I had in Paris, but they were decent. Nice choice for a snack, they have a great selection of European sodas (San Pellegrino, etc). We got some chocolate croissants for the next morning's breakfast (they were very good) and delicious chocolate Ã©clairs to go (which were the best we had in a long time, the custard was just right). Amelie is a cute place to hang out for breakfast, lunch, meet with a friend. If you live in the area or visit Charlotte, give it a try, it won't disappoint.

It took me a while to decide on the Better Nutter (reinvented nutter butter) and a tropezienne (not really sure if that's spelled correctly). My boyfriend got the strawberry croissant and the pain au chocolat. I really enjoyed the Better Nutter. It was very tasty, and brought back the memories of eating Nutter Butters but SOOOOO MUCH BETTER. I'd definitely come back for these =] highly recommended The tropezienne is like a bready pastry with cream in the middle, there was also strawberry slices in it.

"Bon Appetit named Sweet Republic a Top 10 Ice Cream Shop, so when I was in Phoenix, I went out of my way to pay them a visit. Thankfully, not too far out of my way. I had high expectations because of all the accolades bestowed on this shop by foodies in the know. My first impression was not good. It's located in a strip mall, with rickety outdoor tables and chairs situated in between two trash cans. The appearance does improve once you get in the front door. It's decorated nicely and there were a couple teenagers at a table playing board games they got from the stash of games at the back of the shop. It had a nice vibe. They rotate their flavors of ice cream and sorbet so you get what you get. Too bad the menu on the wall didn't match what was in the cases. I was disappointed they didn't have a chocolate peanut butter cup flavor. Instead, they had Peanut Butter Chip, which was churned peanuts with chocolate flakes. Nothing else looked appealing to me so that's what I ordered. The texture was weird- kind of icy, not creamy. There were little pieces of peanuts that didn't help matters and the teensy flakes of dark chocolate were not abundant enough to add to the flavor. It was altogether odd. My sister had lemon sorbet and her review was, ""Meh."" We couldn't really figure out what was so great about this place.",2,Negative,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown

They also have great pastries, now of course, if you don't like petit fours and croissants, tarts and quiche, don't go. I preferably was looking for cheesecake on first trip and was kindly told it's a French Bakery lol So on my next trip I tried out a few of their cream cheese croissants. Now that was heaven!

"What a disappointment! We had dinner in the Venetian and did some walking around and shopping. I always develop a sweet tooth after dinner, we saw the Carlos Bake Shop sign and knew that was our next stop. It was across from Buddy V's Restaurant. The bake shop had a steady flow of customers. Even though it was late there was still a decent selection in the cases. We decided to get Vanilla cupcakes and a Creme Puff. The prices are pretty much on par with most cupcake shops/bakeries in town. The staff was pleasant and helpful. The Creme Puff was very small and pretty average tasting, had more whipped creme in than Bavarian creme. On to the cupcakes. Ugh! I have never refused to finish my cupcake until now! I LOVE cake, but this was horrible. Super dry with no taste, did they forget to add the vanilla?? If a baker can't make a plain vanilla cake then you have no business being a baker. The icing was pretty average but didn't help the cupcake one bit. The other factors in this visit saved them from getting a 1 STAR review. Skip this place if you are craving cake!!

"So this is one I've been waiting for and I am excited that I get to finally review it. Ambiance: The decor is fairly the same as the ones that I have seen in California. I mean it is a franchise so no surprise there and no complaints. There's a good amount of cases for people to go to when choosing what they want to grab and the line weaves its way through. Service: Now service was good. There was a lot of people when I went so there was a bit of a wait but compared with the amount of people it definitely was not to bad. Service was fairly quick so no complaints. A girl named Kiara was our cashier and she was nice, quick, and when my mom asked if they had Taro bread she kindly offered to grab us a couple before it made its way to the cases which I did appreciate. Food: This is always the highlight. I never have any complaint and this is the same. My personal favorites are the Taro marble bread, egg tarts, and chocolate bread. The taro bread is always nice and subtle. Chocolate bread was good with some powder sugar on the top. The egg tarts are always a big one for me because the crust is always so flakey and the filling is sweet. A new favorite I've come to add is if you're looking for something on the savory side their Kale spinach danish definitely make my tummy happy. Overall, I'm glad we finally have one in our city. Only thing that I wasn't pleased with was the wait just because if you've been to other 85's then you know they're pretty quick but I'm sure they'll get faster once they fully settle in.

"I have pretty high standards for cupcakes, as a friend owns her own cupcake business and hers are second to none. I've also had not-so-good cupcakes at another Sprinkles, so I was half hesitant to try this location. I'm glad I did. They really redeemed themselves. The last one I had was dry with hard icing. I had a pumpkin cupcake at this one and it was moist (sorry, moist-o-phobes) and the frosting, though thin, was rich. The flavor was spot on. While it wasn't nearly as good as the ones my friend makes, it was worth what I paid for it and it made up for bad experiences in the past.

"If you ever need a reason to visit downtown Las Vegas, look no further. Previously, I tried the lemon pistachio, apple-fritter, and maple donut. I was looking forward to getting the lemon pistachio but was disappointed to learn that they change the menu weekly. Today, I decided to try the Boston creme, creme brulee, Nutella overload, strawberry split, and caramel latte. I also got an old-fashioned donut which is a cake donut with sprinkles. What I love about these donuts is that it doesn't leave an oily taste on your lips afterward. They are so soft and fluffy on the inside and full of flavor. The cream in the Boston cream and creme brulee was not overly sweet and had just the right amount inside. I don't care for cake donuts because they are usually dense and heavy; I just wanted to try this one, and it was no different. The donuts are a little on the pricey side ranging from $1.00 with the most expensive being $5.00. There is construction going on in downtown Las Vegas. If you are coming from Las Vegas Blvd to Carson street, it's closed, so you have to go around the corner and come down on the road.

There were so many dessert choices that we simply just came here for the popular recommended items which were the cannolis and the lobster tails. We got the original and chocolate canollis. It was different from all the kinds of pastries I've had so it was nice to try something new at a bakery. It was good but not enough to make me crave for more. It had cream wrapped in crispy shells. I preferred the lobster tails over the cannolis though. It's a flaky puffed pastry that was filled with cream. It was rich in flavor but it was delish! Although, the prices of these pastries would make me think twice about splurging on these dessert again. The cannolis were $3.50 a piece and the lobster tails were $5.95 each. These little things added up in total that I spent $50 to share among 8 people. It wasn't that the pastries we had weren't good, it's just that it hasn't lived up to the hype of what people portrayed or expect it to be coming from a big famous name company. It was worth trying though if you haven't had any!",3,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,Negative,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Churn is an extraordinarily cute Ice Cream parlor located right next to The Windsor. However, for the prices I was under the inclination I was having artisanal ice cream or something. While the ice cream itself was fair and admittedly very very fresh, the prices are a bit extortionist. They do have a lot of options to go with the ice cream, from customized cones to a variety of toppings but I truly do not think the ice cream was as expensive as they made it out to be. Also, for anyone that is curious at all, their rotational menu is all their flavors on rotation, they only really serve about 8-10 flavors at the location. You might want to call and ask what they have before you make the trek there or refer to the online menu, I *believe* it's updated daily.

"Went there for an inexpensive afternoon snack. Outside seating is nice - although it is right by a bus stop and the main street. Previous reviews indicated that it was a little gem within expensive restaurants. I couldn't disagree more. The ham and cheese baguette I had was probably one of the worst I have ever had. It was old, dry and rubbery/chewy. They did however offer to toast my bitten into sandwich. Bouchon quality for me means freshly made to order sandwiches and not pre-made old ones from the morning.

"We came here around 12:30pm before closing. I didn't expect to buy leftover donuts but they were a great deal at the moment so we decided to fill the box up with $10. Half of the box were all creme brÃ»lÃ©e, the rest were weird unwanted assorted donuts. The donuts were cold, chewy and unappetizing. Maybe it was because we came late... I wasn't very happy but for the price, it was $1 per donut approximately. None of the donuts were that good, just taste like a regular mom and pop kind of place. I also got a Nitro infused coffee because the guy recommended me as something new to try. Pricey and wasn't worth it. The coffee was SOUR! I'm not sure if it's supposed to taste that way... I mean if you really put your mind to it, you might find it drinkable. I'm a huge coffee lover and it hardly got me to finish half after an hour of walking around downtown.

The ice cream was probably the best I have ever had; you can definitely tell it is homemade. We decided on their Lucky Charm ice cream was crazy good and got the fruity pebble macaroon, which was gooey and perfect in every way.

"I want to start off by saying I've never actually gone inside the establishment, but I follow them on Instagram and all the fitness models post epic cheat meals with these donuts. So~ when my friend went to Vegas, I made him bring home a dozen for me. Little did I know, a dozen would actually be 2 big boxes! It was totally worth making him lug it around though. Because these donuts were so bomb! We do not have anything like these in Philly. I mean a donut with a poptart in it?! Anyways, after cutting a piece of each flavor to taste them, I ended up freezing them because I couldn't possibly eat them all in one sitting, well I could, but I decided I shouldn't. Well let me tell you, have any of you guys tried frozen donuts before? It was probably even better than when I tried it fresh! How could that be possible?! Well some of the donuts were too sweet when I had it fresh (the poptart one especially) and when it was frozen it was the perfect amount of sweetness. I still dream of eating these donuts. I need to make a trip to Vegas.",5,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

The people who I was with got a cake batter donut and a regular cinnamon sugar one, and I tried a few bites of theres, and they were amazing! I live in LA, and I hope they will open one (or many) there ASAP, because it would be wildly successful, and I would eat there a ton. Until then, I will be coming back to this location and all the others and getting new donuts.

"It was my first time to Melt. And wow! Most delicious, amazing ice cream...the Cookie Monster, oh my! However, I have to say the customer service killed my overall experience. Music was jamming with a line out the door, but once you got inside you weren't made to feel welcomed. The two working didn't appear to have any excitement serving the anxious and excited customers making the nights most important decision; what flavor?! They had their heads down on their phones for the majority of check out. There was no ""hey guys welcome to melt! Let us know if you have any questions."" Or ""thanks so much for coming in tonight...we'll see you back soon!"" ""Is this your first time in? If so we have punch cards."" The only conversation I had with the girl was ""make sure you bring your flight tray back inside."" My dad has owned a restaurant for 30 years and from my experience I have learned that customer service can make or break your overall experience. Those working for you are supposed to represent your business in the most positive way possible; you kind of expect that being in the downtown Roosevelt district where people represent a chill, cool, and friendly vibe. With all of that said, keep making delicious ice cream at Melt! The flavors are inventive and who doesn't love the take-out containers with the crunch of the fortune cookie to end the party in your mouth.

"My girlfriend was hungry for dessert after a D'Backs game on Tuesday, but it was almost 10pm. I wasn't optimistic we'd find a dessert spot downtown that late on a week night. But low and behold, Yelp saved the day and helped me find this place just a few blocks from my apartment. They've only been open about 2 months, but per the Yelp reviews already seemed to be garnering a fan base. The place sits in a historic home pretty much in the heart of First Fridays territory. In case you get lost looking for this place, just look for the neon ""Munchies"" sign. When we walked in it was just the owner (who also happens to be the owner of JoBot Coffee). Super nice guy. They don't make their own ice cream, but rather have it made by a local co-op. Their flavors range from Chocolate Raspberry to Chips & Salsa. After sampling seemingly every flavor, I went with a scoop of Cinnamon and a scoop of Vanilla Birthday Cake. When you order a cup as I did, you don't get a cup but rather a Chinese noodle box complete with fortune cookie. Random? Yup. But freaking awesome. She got the Chocolate Superfarm and the Raspberry. There's no seating inside, but there's plenty on the front porch. We were the only ones there (not surprisingly since it was so late on a Tuesday), but thoroughly enjoyed the ice cream and overall experience. Great way to cap off the evening.",5,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"Napa's finest in Vegas. This Bouchon location is more of a food stall close to the guest elevators. Next to Grand Lux. They have an actual location in Venetian but I do not think it was open. Busy right when they open. Pastries were fresh. Prices are reasonable for the being in Vegas. Chocolate Croissant - $4 - Flaky and good amount of chocolate inside. Cheese Danish - $4 - Thick and a bit to dense for me. Was not a fan of the cheese. Pistachio Macaron - $4 - Good crust and chewy body. Smaller then the napa one I had. Ton of pistachio flavor. Coffee, large - $4.25 - Basic and overpriced.",4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Weight watchers beware, this place is simply full of sweets and fattening ice cream sandwiches! You have to admit though that it's a good idea to Treat Yo'self every once in awhile. For those occasions where only delicious desserts will satisfy, I couldn't recommend Ninety's enough! If you're familiar with the boardwalk in the university area then you probably already know where it's at. Park on the side closest to the Light Rail and look for the Chinese restaurant, it's across the walk from there. While there's not much to talk of concerning the decor, it is very clean and there's a bit of seating for people looking to beat the heat. It seems that they're banking on most enjoying their treats on the boardwalk, the rest of the building quickly fills up with excited families and individuals alike wanting a delicious snack. So as far as the treats, what tickles your fancy? They have macaron ice cream sandwiches, ice cream filled doughnuts, ice cream cake pops, all kinds of desserts. You can also get your ice cream in a cup or cone, but why would you? The couple of macaron ice cream sandwiches I've gotten here were outstanding and well thought out. They offer different flavors of macarons paired with specific ice creams and toppings. The team even seems to have a thing for cereals, and incorporates them into a lot of their products! I have to admit, I didn't expect the macarons themselves to be such a high quality product since they're being used in ice cream sandwiches, but I'd say these were excellent macarons. They could even stand on their own with a traditional filling if they chose to do so. Maybe something to consider! I'd love give 'em the perfect score, but last time they were out of a LOT of the specials. They were very accommodating with substitutes, for example they were out of the samoa macaron and just did a regular vanilla on my sandwich. My girlfriend also wanted the coffee ice cream sandwich and they were out of its 'biscotti' macaron so she had to settle for a substitute as well. All in all it they were out of 3 macarons, and 2 ice creams. So I hope that next time I'm able to try some of their named creations as they intended. Still, a very good package either way.

I wasn't a big fan of the cupcake... it was too sweet and it was more of a milk chocolate rather than a dark chocolate. The ice cream was pretty good though. They offer a mini size for the sundae, however, they only have limited flavors for the cupcake. I would probably opt for that one if I come back.

Yes, Sprinkles is tiny, yes it's crowded, and yes they are quick/efficient. 5 stars for service that's for sure. I didn't try any of their ice creams, but that's happening soon. I tried the Carrot Cake and Peanut Butter Chip cupcakes. For those that know me, know that I love a good carrot cake and anything with peanut butter. So here are my thoughts on both.... Peanut Butter Chip Cupcake: This was so good, moist, had just enough chocolate, and packed with a creamy peanut buttery taste. I've had a few peanut butter cupcakes in my lifetime and would honestly rank Sprinkles near the top. If you're a fan of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, then you'll be a fan of Sprinkles' Peanut Butter Chip Cupcake. My only regret is getting only one. Carrot Cake: The icing was good, but thought that the actual cupcake could have been better. This was packed with a ton of carrots and a little dry. Again, I've had carrot cake cupcakes before and have yet to find one that I really like. Sprinkles didn't impress me with their Carrot Cake. But hey...it's all about their Peanut Butter Chip. If you're at the Linq, then I recommend that you check out Sprinkles and judge them for yourself.

Next time I will try a shake or some of their soft serve concoctions. Will definitely be back. I'd give it a perfect score but it's a bit too pricey, hey, it is the strip. 4.5 stars.",4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

Sorely disappointed. The hot fudge sundae was lukewarm at best and turned my stomach upside down. We tried to non pareils and the box didn't close and the woman at the front was flippant about it when we asked for a different one which she didn't and just stuck a sticker on it. And the box still didn't work.They haven't had brownies for 2 weeks but no where did they have a sign which indicated that. Only reason I gave 2 stars instead of one is that I like Ghirardelli chocolate but rest of the experience was subpar. I realize places are understaffed and it must be a challenge to find good employees.,2,Negative,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"I wish I could give this 2.5 stars. We came on three separate occasions, but only actually ordered twice because the line around 7PM on a weekday was absurdly large.

"My friend recommended this place and told me their soft serve ice cream are good. So I came with high expectations. We ordered cereal milk with extra corn flakes topping and a crake pie soft serve. The ice cream was very creamy, especially the crake pie flavor. But i think it is lacking some in depth flavor in the ice cream. The first few bit was good but you can get board easily.

"I have had my heart set on Milk Bar since we ran out of time to go on my last NYC visit, it was birthday weekend so my husband wanted to bring me to this location! The service was awesome, the ladies were so sweet & helpful, we ordered a cereal milk affogato, slice of crack pie and candy bar pie, malted cake balls & a cookie for my daughter. Affogato was horrible, as in, inedible horrible. Crack Pie is just like buttermilk pie, the Candy Bar slice was great but just so rich, malted cake balls were meh, couldn't detect the malt flavor. It was all sickeningly sweet and most of it just went in the trash. We were so unbelievably underwhelmed, our total was over $30 & I was really hoping to be wow'd at those prices. We won't be back.",1,Negative,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Believe it or not, there are some people who live in Vegas that think anything under 80 degrees is freezing. Wink wink! But if there's one thing that's going to get them outside to brave the harshest of frozen desert temperatures in the winter, especially if they're the Yelping type, it's ice cream. I don't know much about the history of Handel's, just mainly that they're from Ohio and people all across the country love them. This new location, while possibly different from others I've heard about, is completely walk up service only. It's located in a shopping center on the NE corner of Tropicana & Hualapai. And even with a space size that puts pretty much every ice cream shop in town to shame, there is absolutely no where safe from the elements that is customer accessible. Well, besides their own vehicles of course. With 5+ walk up windows preparing to operate during all business hours, there shouldn't be any problem getting you served up pretty quickly though. On the menu, you're going to find probably way more options then you'll know what do with. There's hurricanes, sundaes, parfaits, ice cream sandwiches, shakes...the list goes on! And if you just want a good ole fashioned scoop or two, there's about 40 or so different choices between the regular ice cream flavors, sherbets and the monthly special. I'm all for having options, but to be honest, there's almost too much here. It could be just be my indecisiveness kicking in, but it was a bit overwhelming. I will say this though. The 4 scoop sampler is one of the coolest things they offer, and I'd imagine it's got to be pretty popular. It's exactly what I ended up going with, and is a steal at only $4.25. It took a while but we ended up going with Banana Cream Pie, Buckeye, Chocolate Peanut Butter Brownie and Spouse Like A House (vanilla ice cream with peanut butter ripple and chocolate covered peanut butter pretzels swirled in). Each flavor was spot on with what they described and I'd have a hard time picking out a favorite of the four. The banana had a nice, smooth whipped cream type texture and big chunks of banana. The Buckeye had plenty of whole candies in it, which are basically like a big Rolo, but with peanut butter inside. And both the Chocolate Peanut Butter Brownie and Spouse Like A House had plenty of peanut butter flavor without having that terrible frozen peanut butter texture. All were a tad on the sweet side, but very creamy and delicious. The only thing I didn't like is that they all started to melt pretty quick, even in the January winter weather. I imagine during the summer, it'll be tough to finish before you have sugar soup. For being all window ordering, the service is very friendly. Each employee we talked to was very friendly and seemed to be quite knowledgeable about the products. With our visit being on the first day open, I think that's pretty impressive. Adding that to good quality products at great prices, I'll definitely be returning to Handel's!",4,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

I had the sugar-free, and I think the frosting was even better than a regular Red Velvet. My husband proclaimed the Salted Caramel as amazing, my daughter inhaled the regular Sprinkled- and we are saving the seasonal until tomorrow! (If we can.) I feel these are well worth the price ($4). Our cashier was fast and friendly, and encouraged me to join their rewards program, recommending I save my rewards points for ice cream, as it's more expensive!

I'm not someone who likes too much cream or icing on the top of my cupcake so the amount that they provide is just perfect. However, the cupcake is a little small for the price ($5/cupcake) but other than that it is phenomenal. They have an ATM cupcake machine outside of the store which is really cute and fun to order through. But even better, inside they have a ton of cupcake and ice cream combinations to choose from as well as toppings. They cut the top of the cupcake off and put ice cream in between the top and bottom of the cupcake. It is a match made in heaven!

"My wife saw Milk Bar all over social media and had to try. Overall the presentation was nice and it is in Cosmopolitan, so don't expect decent pricing. We ordered the soft serve with and without the corn flake topping, 4 cookies, and the birthday cake balls. We were disappointed, all I can say is that it tastes like super salty dessert. Just overloaded with salt. We weren't expecting great things, but few things are more frustrating than paying a lot of money for bad food. The cookies and cake balls were ok, but again, too much salt and you can get better desserts else where in Las Vegas, like Crumbl or try one of the many bakeries in China Town. I'm giving two stars because the soft serve with the corn flake topping was good, but it was horrible without the topping. We ended up throwing away half of what we ordered, it was not good and waayyyyy too salty. If you like salty desserts, then by all means, but it wasn't for me.

The banana cream pie had chunks of banana and pie crust, it was just like eating the pie itself. If I lived in Cleveland, I would only buy Mitchell's, they're THAT GOOD. Mitchell's has some seating available in their brightly lit shop and the line goes fairly quick. I'm pretty sure that everything Mitchell's offers is delicious and rich.

"I was so excited for Milk Bar's arrival. And, I was So disappointed. I got 3 cookies, a shake, and a soft serve ice cream. Everything was OK, but for $26 I expected to be blown away and I wasn't. There are off Strip places for way less money turning out a much better product. I wished that this location was more bakery and less walk up counter. I think when you SEE items in a bakery case... It's part of the experience. Everything here is already packaged to go or, with the frozen treats, you don't see them until you get them. Also, there is no seating anywhere. The Birthday Cake shake was tasty, but fairly small for $10. The soft serve cup is one size, but they do fill it up. I got the cereal milk flavor with the cornflake topping. It definitely tasted like it was supposed to which I enjoyed, bit the ice cream had a weird texture that was off-putting...like the cream was curdled or something. I threw it away about halfway through. Cookies was an OK size and a chewy texture, but 3 for $8?!?!? Completely overpriced.

Make SURE to grab a croissant (any kind or flavor they have!!) because they will leave you craving for more - so crisp, soft and delicious at the same time.

"Some things are so good that it's wise you keep it at arms length. I'd have to say that Amelie's falls into that foodie category. Between the pastries, eclectic crowd, creative decor and 24-hour access, I'm pretty sure I'd be a blimp if I lived in N. Davidson! I'm visiting Charlotte this week and hanging with the TonyaP so I knew this place HAD to be good. We popped in last night and there was a line snaking in front of the counter but not to worry, it moves quickly. I stuck my head into the side room and was amazed at what I saw: antiqued furniture, high ceilings and lush fabrics. Everything at Amelie's falls under creative, shabby chic! Loved the overhead light piece shrouded by stainless steel cups, graters and other kitchen items. My eyes immediately got drawn to the lit pastry case where my visual tummy was dazzled by the array of delectable sweets. Pecan pie, fruit tarts, napoleons, eclairs and more, me wants it all! I took it ""easy"" ordering up three items and everything was boxed up for us. But if you know Tonya or myself, we are NOT gonna wait. Plopped ourselves down on some stools and dug in. That pecan pie was wonderful, full of nuts to counteract the rich, sweet filling. And a great sweet crust that wasn't over-baked. One of the best pecan pies I've had since it was more nutty than usual, I tried to hog it all up but shared a bite with my Yelp host. I was buzzing with the sugar so I wisely held off on the peach tart and sea salt brownie until laters... Seriously good baked goods, there's a lot of love and talent being placed into their product here. Update: Finally ate the sea salt caramel brownie and it was UNBELIEVABLE! What can I say but Amelie's rocked it out for me! This bakery would do well in any urban center including San Francisco, call me impressed. So Charlotte, enjoy Amelie's for everything it's got. I for one am totally jealous that you've got this amazingly tempting bakery here. Thankfully I'm 150 miles away, Amelie!

"If you're drunk, wandering on the strip, these goodies will probably be the most gratifying things ever.. other than Yoshinoya! It's a fun and trendy chain but this popular cupcake spot has only been ""okay"" for me. I've tried several of their flavors but the ones that stuck out was the Triple Cinnamon and the Banana. The taste and sweetness is fantastic. The cake has a consistent moisture and the frosting is thick! However, I was not THAT impressed.. I've had much better cupcakes at small mom&pop bakeries. At about $4 a cupcake, I expected much better. For quick, convenient cupcake service, Sprinkles has an express cupcake ATM(w/service charge) located outside of the shop. It's such a neat idea, it's hard not to try it.. or at least Instagram it. haha What I was looking forward to was their icecream. But yet again, I was heavily disappointed. I ordered the Red Velvet icecream with graham cracker crumbs. I don't know if my sweet tooth malfunctioned that day but the entire dessert was bland. Their red velvet icecream is basically a sweet cream/vanilla with red velvet cupcake chunks in it. I had bites that had big chunks of cake and graham cracker, but still was not getting that sweet satisfaction. I'll definitely come back again to try different flavors and hopefully re-rate this shop higher.",3,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

It's in a nice, working class neighborhood with well maintained houses just off 7th Ave. it's an area quickly gaining a good reputation for innovative and high quality dining choices. As soon as we walked in we were welcomed by Brandon who told us about their ice cream, the awards they've won and what they are most famous for: stuffed doughnuts. After my family and I tried several samples we each chose a different flavor and a topping for our stuffed doughnut. It's a glazed doughnut without the hole that is used to make a sandwich for their delicious, creamy ice cream. The food alone was worth a 5 star review. But I wish I could give it 6 stars because Brandon and the two helpful and charming young ladies that helped us were warm and friendly and made us feel so welcome.

"We have been wanting to try Jack Frost Donuts for quite sometime now - so yesterday we made it happen! We had to take a friend back to the airport and thought after all we have read about them that this would be a perfect place to eat away our sadness :-) Jack Frost offers raised and cake donuts. We had to ask the lady at the counter to tell us what our choices were as they are not labeled. She did an OK job but she did not really ""sell"" me on any really. I would have thought me saying it was our first time she might have been more helpful but she wasn't. She did not even point to what was what as she rambled off their names. In the end we purchased a mixed dozen and a half in order to sample a variety of styles and flavors. We had some lemon, some turtle, some salted caramel, some maple bacon, some of their cream sticks and some krullers. I am not usually a fan of a cake donut but theirs are different than most. When I normally eat a cake donut they are very heavy and crumbly but these had a bit moister consistency to them. I tried the Salted Caramel and it was not super sweet - just enough icing to give it a little flavor. I would have like it to taste like caramel but it really did not. It did have a bit of salt flavor though. The Maple Bacon was delicious! The icing is really delicious and the bacon had a great flavor and not just like bacon bits being used. It was the one donut out of all of these I think I would want again. My husband and my sister each had a lemon and they said they were good but nothing as special as we had hoped. I was most disappointed in the cream sticks and Neapolitan we got. The fillings used are very grainy and not flavorful in my opinion. The worst one being the peanut butter. It was overly grainy and way too sweet. We also tried their turtle cake donuts and they were not too bad but the chocolate creme on one of them was lackluster. It was a great idea but there was not much chocolate flavor to it so it fell short of its intended goal. The one without actually tasted better because of this. I really wanted to like this place I had heard so much hype about it, but all in all it was very average. I might try it again just to see if it was an off day...but only if I am on that side of town for something else.",3,Negative,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

As you waited (and waited some more) you could peruse the menu. I noticed that most flavors were only available certain days of the week and a handful of flavors were available every single day. I guessed that these were very popular flavors and when I heard they would let you try two flavors I decided to test my theory out. I tried Rocky Road which is my go to flavor but when I tried SALTED CARMEL something magical happened in my mouth and brain. When I think about it now, the name SALTED CARMEL requires me to type in all caps, but what I really want to type is SALTED MUTHA EFFIN CARMEL. Holy Samoan on a tightrope batman! This flavor is the bizness. So much so that I went back less than 48 hours later to bring a friend to try it and have another magical dopamine firework show go off in my brain. The second time I felt like a big piggy for being there again so soon so I asked for a kids cup size and they really tried to convince me that it would be too small. I stuck to my guns and was glad I did because it was the perfect size. Thankfully this place is on the strip and not right near my house. If you're at the Linq you should try this place and the SALTED MUTHA EFFIN CARMEL ice cream. You'll be thanking me and hating me at the same time.",4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
freaking love this place!!!! All their breads are so delicious and fresh. My favorites are the garlic cheese bread and the mango custard bread. Their drinks are delish too! I would recommend the peach green tea or jasmine green tea or salted caramel coffee. All my favorites! I haven't had any of their desserts but I'm sure they are just as good.

My only disappointment was when I tried to get one more Caffeine fix before leaving Vegas and they weren't open at 7:30 am. Milk Bar...if you are going to serve such great coffee, you need to be open earlier! It's an order at the counter kind of place, which can sometimes feel a little rushed, but the staff is very friendly and accommodating. We will definitely be back.

Lunch items are no longer offered on the menu, this place had the best BLT sandwich that was loaded with bacon. Even though the lunch items are gone Mary Coyle's is serving up some of the most delicious sweet treats, some of the best ice cream in town. On this visit my lunch companion and I shared the Caramel Cashew ""God Bless You"" and the ""Thick Ol' Fashion Chocolate Milkshake"" and both were delicious. The ""God Bless You"" was the perfect mix of Vanilla & salted caramel cashew ice cream, caramel topping, topped with cashews, whip cream and a cherry on top. The ice cream was smooth, rich and full of flavor as was the chocolate shake.

It is a good thing Handel's Homemade Ice Cream is on the other side of town! YUM. Super friendly staff and it is delicious. No place to sit down- just counter to order from.

"All the hype not the best donuts I've ever had.. looks aesthetically beautiful, but lacks flavor and all the donuts were pretty much just all dough. We bought 8 donuts and most of it went in the trash. I live in Summerlin paid $20 for Parking and spent $35 for donuts. Wanted to see for myself what all the hype was about.

"I am not much of a fan for glorified ice cream, but this place is pretty decent. Their cookies are pretty good. They have a lot of flavors and cater to different tastes. My favorites are the chocolate ones. I think they have one called triple chocolate, and for chocolate lovers out there, this is definitely one to try. The ice cream is really good too. I tried the milk cream with cornflake crunch and I was blown away. Before trying the ice cream, I thought it was just vanilla covered in the Corn Flakes cereal. I was sure wrong. The ice cream was very delicious and not too creamy. The flakes are what make the ice cream, and they give you a healthy amount. Each bite you take is filled with bunches of flakes and they even give you a good serving on the bottom of the cup, so you aren't stuck with just the toppings on top. The flakes are very savory and each bite is filled with bits of joy. I would definitely come back here again for a nice cup of ice cream.",4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

I bought a pint to go and a pint of the salted caramel, which was good, not great. Not nearly as good as the Honey Bleu Cheese. The ice cream is high quality, and it should be for $7.50 a pint! That's the only reason I don't give them 5 stars. It is pricey for what is - ice cream.

"Campbell's Popcorn Shop is the latest food destination I'm recommending to people. Usually it goes ""OMG. I wish I had some Dichotomy Mix right now!"" It doesn't matter the time of day, or if I'm hungry. I just love the cheddar/caramel corn mix. People usually say ""Wutch you talkin' bout, Willis?"" and then I tell them all about Campbell's. I like that I can try any flavors from a neat little vending sample machine from the counter. There are also chocolate creations like turtles and peanut butter cups. You may purchase your popcorn by regular or large bags, or tins! I made a special trip on Saturday to Ohio City just to stop and get a couple of bags of the Dichotomy for double booked Saturday parties. I love it when you introduce people to a superior food product and you can literally see the moment while they're taking their first bites and they realize it is superior. I had several of those moments on Saturday night. So far, no matter how good the other flavors are, and they are all good, I have only bought dichotomy.

"My husband, friends, and I were super excited when visiting Vegas and stumbled up the escalator at The Cosmopolitan to the Milk Bar. I am a HUGE Tosi fan and was expecting to be wowed! My husband and I ordered a full Birthday Cake to-go. We waited ~30 minutes for the cake. They boxed it up for us as we wanted to enjoy the cake back in our hotel room. I was so disappointed once we dug in. The cake tasted sour (mainly the frosting). It really had this spoiled sour taste. This has left me questioning their quality control. Did they make the frosting with spoiled milk? We don't live in Vegas so maybe I'll have to give the LA store a try someday.

One person is the cashier, one is the waffle cones maker and only one person waiting on the customers. You can imagine how slow the line moved with some of the customers wanted to sample the ice cream and only one person serving! I ordered the coffee and cream, salted peanut butter with chocolate speckled and Lavender. The Lavender is the only flavor that deserves recognition.

Some tasted better than others. Donuts tasted fresh and the cake wasn't dried. I had half of the green tea one. No green tea taste to it at all. In fact, it tasted more like a lemon flavored donut with green colored frosting on top. The strawberry shortcake and blueberry cheesecake however, was FABULOUS!!!!!! It really taste like it sounds. I can imagine if you have a major sweet tooth, this place would be heavenly for you. I'm glad I was finally able to try their donuts though. But personally, I'm more of a cupcake kinda gal.

The blueberry cake was my personal favorite but I'm also partial to cake doughnuts but it was delicious and not super oily or overly sugary. The perfect cake doughnut.

The menu has a lot of unique offerings in addition to the ability to create your own mix. You can also opt for a milkshake or cereal in a bowl. I always opted for the milkshake, and I personally think that is the way to go. I was able to try the cosmo and Wanda, Scooby snacks, and mucha lucha.

I'm not sure if this a managerial problem, but many times the place will be PACKED and you will have one person tending to customers, and the other one will be making ice cream sandwiches or something equivalently unnecessary (when you can see a refrigerator full of sandwiches that are not being eaten).

"my favorite part of the store is the whole kitschy vibe goin' on. tons of retro candies, cute cake platters piled high w/ obviously homemade baked goods, shiny espresso machine, cute menu, homemade ice cream.... the banana and blackberry flavors were really good. the husband and i shared a sandwich of banana ice cream between a white-choc-cashew? and a kitchen sink cookie.i dunno if i'd go so far to say that they (the ice creams) were a-ma-zing. but they were pretty darn good. (you have to understand that i'm judging based on all of my ice cream experiences... comparing w/ Bi-Rite Creamery, Humphrey Slocombe, Scoops, and myriad other ""gourmet"" ice cream shops). as far as my AZ ice creamery experiences goes... this is pretty up there. i think what stands out about churn is that it is clearly HOMEMADE. and i mean that in a good way. you can tell that they haven't industrialized or lost any of the ""made with love"" touch. which is nice! and different! the main drawback of such a small business is there can be a bit of a wait if you come in with/after a large group. and by large i mean 4 orders of ice cream. we were that large group. oops. summary: Churn is the PERFECT ending to a great dinner at Windsor. support local small businesses!!!",3,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"I was really looking forward to trying Milk Bar, but to my dismay, it really wasn't that great. It's not even that the prices are ridiculous or anything; the sweets just didn't live up to the hype. When we went around 1:30pm on a Sunday, there was about 10 people in line and it didn't take too long to get to the counter. They ran out of a few of the popular cookies so we ended up getting the crack pie, corn cookie, blueberry and cream cookie, birthday cake truffles, and the cereal milk soft serve with cornflake crunch. The crack pie was way too sweet for my taste, though I enjoyed the consistency of the pie.. The blueberry and cream cookie was kind of oily, and the corn cookie was pretty good. I only had a bite of the soft serve because I was so full, but my first impression was slight disappointment and that I've had better.

The guy at the counter asked us to step aside and wait for my sandwich which he said would take 5-10 minutes. I thought I heard him incorrectly. Just do the math in your head to build a sandwich with 4 ingredients. The restaurant was dead. 15 minutes later my fancy French sandwich came out. It was tiny and the chicken was thin grilled pieces.

"Jeni's is ALWAYS on point. Midwest grown and slowly making its way from coast to coast! I first heard about Jeni's several years ago when I met a girl from Ohio when I lived in San Francisco. We became friends and both being from the Midwest we shared some of the things we loved and missed... one of those things for her was Jeni's ice cream! So you can only imagine how excited I was when I was living in St. Louis a few short years later and they opened a location. It was as good as my friend hyped it up to be!! Sadly (well not now, but at the time) I moved to Charlotte and there was no Jeni's. SIGH. Fast forward a year and a half later and BOOM! Jeni's has arrived! I couldn't wait to get in line and once again see if it lived up to the hype... which it did! The flavors are so unique and delicious!! Since it's summer they ended up having a few seasonal flavors, one of those being frose!! It was a delicious sorbet type treat and the one I ended up going with! That is after I tried half the flavors! Again, this isn't your normal ice cream shop and you should enter with an open mind and empty stomach! They'll let you try as many flavors as you want, don't be greedy though, if you find what you're looking for (or if your stomach is telling you yes) GO FOR IT!! They do half scoops which are comparable to a small/kiddie scoop at a regular ice cream shop. $4 for a scoop or three for $6... no brainer, go for THREE! And don't forget fresh, homemade waffle cones or waffle pieces come with every scoop!! If you're looking for that cool delicious treat for your summer evening, hop on over to Jeni's!

Ive never had a macaron before so this was my first time and i loved it! The toasted marshmellow was to die for.. the outter shell it made and breaking it open to find the gooey fluff just ooze out. Ugh, perfection! I could have had 4 of those on my ice cream and i would have been good to go. I will say they are a bit expensive. Mine came out to $8 which, the ice cream was good, but i dont think its good enough for $8..

"Ninety's has SO much hype around it and it's been on my list all summer to try it out. Its University location isn't the most convenient, but I finally made it up there. I'm glad I tried it, but I can't say I walked away thrilled. To be fair, I am not very interested in their specialty treats - the macaron ice cream sandwiches or cookie dough pops.I just tried a good old-fashioned waffle cone with two flavors - moose tracks and some peanut butter pretzel something (the scooper mumbled the flavor name and I heard peanut butter so I went for it). Both flavors were solid - the moose tracks had an insane amount of fudge in it (delicious but honestly a little too much for me) and the peanut butter element of the other flavor was just enough. My friend got the brownie milkshake which was definitely underwhelming. If I go back, I'll try a more exciting milkshake with the edible rim. Otherwise, Two Scoops still wins best ice cream in Charlotte. I gave them four stars for their unique offerings in which I happen to have limited interest. There's gotta be hype for a reason, right?! Note on the location: the shop is located in a large shopping center and parking is somewhat of a nightmare. We went at 8pm on a Friday and it took five minutes to find parking. There was no line when we walked in but there was a long line when we left. Expect this place to be ALWAYS busy.

"I'm going to start this off by saying this is my temporary review of Donut Bar. It's October 2nd, 2019, and after an accidental overcharge this morning, I'll be visiting again several weeks from now for some complimentary donuts per the owner and employee named Olivia. I basically only review donut shops. I literally start most days with a donut and coffee, typically a maple bacon variety. I hope my first experience here was just an outlier, and next time is more enjoyable for me. I gave a star for presentation alone, and a star for the fact my sister loved her vegan CrÃ¨me BrÃ»lÃ©e donut. However, I honestly can't give a star for my Brad Fritter. It was almost flavorless at times. I went through large bites of nothing but borderline undercooked dough; which I spit out. It was rather unpleasant considering what I was anticipating. The fritter itself lacked any real sweetness, for such a large and doughy item, it just didn't work. The only sweetness was from the maple glaze; which I was searching for, because it was delicious when present, but it was scarcely drizzled. The item suffered because of this. There was definitely a generous portion of bacon, but again the fritter truly lacked that sweetness to balance that savory. More maple drizzle or a glaze would have done wonders. I might have even powered through the doughy parts. I only ate the bacon and crispy exterior. When I return I'll prob just try the maple bacon bar, or something seasonal, assuming they honor the free donuts.

Unless you walk all the way to the front door of the Venetian theater and turn around (it'll be behind you) then you could easily spend 30 minutes searching for it (like I did.) Another reviewer said it's near Lux Cafe...not really. It's a good bit away from it. The casino signs for it stop when you're still too far away to find it, and casino staff seemed not to have heard of it. I asked two - one sent me to the Lux Cafe bakery; the other tried to send me to the restaurant, which is located on another floor. Fairly pricy. Service was average; staff let a drunk woman cut in front of me and said nothing about it. They got my order wrong, but fortunately I checked my bag, and they did fix it when I asked. But the biggest reason for 2 stars: Seriously underwhelming pastry. I ordered a macaron, TKO (Thomas Keller Oreo), a bouchon, a croissant, and a mini almond loaf, and coffee. The only things I would have ordered again are the coffee (not exceptional but good) and the almond loaf, which was quite tasty if not ideally fresh. The TKO was decent but too sweet - that white chocolate ganache didn't blow me away. I'm pretty damn sure that everything except possibly the TKO was not baked that same day.

Then you pick a flavor, a topping and an ingredients and they will create one just for you. You have a choice of having it on a waffle cone or a cup. I picked the waffle cone (and I regret it later because it was too much and messy). They also sell unique drinks that I would like to try next time. Since it was my first time, I ordered one from premade menu (I think it was called Oreo something). It took them at least 15 minutes to make the ice cream, but we did not mind to wait since it was a Friday night. If you want to go in and out of there, just keep that in mind. I also tried a sip of the Strawberry Macha Latte. It has a unique taste to it, but I am not sure if I would order it for me.

"True Rating: 3.5 Sweet and Savory My friends have hyped up this place for a while now, so I decided to check this place out the past MDW. I ordered the cereal milk ice cream with corn flakes and hot fudge. The ice cream base in my opinion was just ok. I am usually into creamy ice creams, but this my friends was not. However, I did enjoy the toppings. The corn flakes were sprinkled with salt and super crunchy as for the hot fudge it was not too overwhelming and loved the fact that they used dark chocolate. Final Verdict: It's okay.",3,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

The Ohio City location is cool. Nice and roomy and bright, and the train that goes around the restaurant is soothing. It is best to go to the second floor, where you can watch them making ice cream.

The outside has the perfect crispness, and the inside is soft, moist, and chewy. The chocolate macaroon tastes like a brownie, but wayyyy better than any normal brownie.

I ended up getting a lobster tail, California cheesecake, and crumb cake. Waited another 15+ min for my name to be called so I can pay. There isn't a line for anything, so you really need to pay attention what they're calling out. Ended up being around $25 for those three items. Lobster tail was eh, cream was bland and the pastry was crispy to the point where it was hard. California cheesecake was nothing special or unique. The crumb cake was the most disappointing, it tasted like a dry sponge with brown sugar lumps on top, not even kidding.

"While walking by the Strip, we've stopped at the Venetian for lunch and happened to pass by Carlo's Bakery. I used to walked Cake Boss on TLC, so just for nostalgia's sake, I decided to get some treats here. Good: I really wanted to say it lives up to the hype, but it doesn't. If you go during the day, the line up is pretty long, so go in the evening and you'll wait less. The service was good and the staff was courteous. Location is pretty clean too. Bad: I've gotten 2 cannoli, one dipped in chocolate and one regular. The chocolate one had a dry and waxy taste, which wasn't awful but wasn't pleasant neither. It just didn't taste fresh. I've had better cannolis from Italian pastry shops back in Montreal. At $4 a piece, it's still pretty hefty for a mediocre pastry. Bottom line: me thinks not. I don't think I would go back and wait in line again. The other food didn't look tempting neither, so I don't think I'd be interested in trying anything else.",2,Negative,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Negative,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown
French pastries - YES! I've tried numerous pastries at Amelie's and my favorites must be their macarons. By god the seasonal pumpkin macaron is like tasting everything there is to love about the fall season in a few small bites. Just wonderful.

I work downtown and have visited this shop numerous times and have yet to have a pleasant experience with the staff. The teenagers working there are too busy on their phones to care about helping you. I visited a few minutes before close and was immediately met with annoyance.

"After the long wait, I finally reached this place with my gf. The first thing that surprised me was that this place was a small stand, rather than a shop itself. I was a bit bummed. The pastries didn't look all that either. Ay other care or even a planera is much better. We ordered a vanilla and eggnog macaron along with their red velvet cupcake. The macarons are large in size for $3.50 and didn't have an eye popping flavor or bite to it. I prefer Paulette's up in SF. The cupcake was in cool temp that the cake was stiff and the frosting sucked. Something unique with it was the inside filling of cream cheese. It compared to whole foods cupcake lol.

"I grew up in Charlotte and i must say that this place is King of Desserts. My very favorite is the macaroons and the chocolate Eclairs.. Yummy . they pile on the chocolate and Custard.. OMG. they are delicious.. a little bit pricey but if you want the real thing then this place is where you'll find almost any thing that you can imagine or something you have not had in 20 years,.. yep.. it's here.. I gave them a 5 because they deserve it. i cant think of any other place even close to where i live that has the variety of baked goodies. my sister goes there weekly and brings over a lot of great things from this place.. I am so glad that they are in Charlotte and especially that they are open 24/7..i dont understand that especially being on that side of Charlotte but hey its good to know that they're in town. i only wish there was a Amelie's French Bakery in the Gaston county area. I am from Mount Holly and i would buy much more from them if there were a little closer to my home..As far as what i have eaten there its definitely a 5 star..Please open up another bakery in Gaston county someday.. i really hope you would do that. you would rock this town and there would be no competition that could come close to what you guys serve. i mean it. there are a few wanna be bakeries in Gastonia but their pastries are made early in the morning and by 5 0r 6 PM its old and not Fresh. Stale in other words. I would say their name but i would not want to embarrass them or humiliate the company.. they are so-so but not the real thing like you have.. and lastly..your food is always FRESH...Thanks for being part of Charlotte and NoDa....",5,Positive,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

We are temporarily living in Columbus and Graeter's is the end all here- not anywhere close to Mitchell's in terms of its creative flavors and good tasting, creamy, and flavorful ice cream. My favorite flavors are Rocky Road and the Bing Chocolate Cherry chunk- never can decide which to have so I always get the Taster's duo. Cleveland's- feel fortunate that you have Mitchell's- some cities we have visited have no locally made ice cream at all- their idea of good ice cream are chains.

"I read about this place on The Pioneer Woman blog, and when Peter and I planned a visit to Ikea we decided to make a stop. We split a Croque Monsier. It was tasty, but next time we come here (the will be a next time for sure!) I'd probably try something else, or skip lunch altogether and just pick up some dessert. We got quite a selection of baked goods, and would order most again. We had some macarons and a salted caramel brownie at the actual restaurant. We both loved the pistachio, but the orange and lemon tasted a little bit like Fruit Loops and seemed stale compared to the pistachio. We took home a box full of goodies (another brownie, an eclair, a chocolate croissant, two more macarons, and a petit four) that we ate over the next couple of days. All were delicious. Peter said the eclair was exactly what an eclair should be. My favorite was the salted caramel brownie, it was heaven. I am a sucker for anything salty, especially sweet and salty, so this is no surprise.

Do not leave here without getting one of their massive chocolate croissants (i know those are French and not Italian but my oh my!!)! If you're looking for a cake, the Italian Wedding Cake is marvelous. You can get cake by the slice or order an entire one to take home -- they've got a ton of flavors to choose from! I also love the pastries, like the turnovers and chocolate croissants (they're packed with so much chocolate and are so flaky). I'm a cannoli connoisseur, so I do have to say that I'm not a fan of their cannoli; the cream is a little thick and not as silky as I like a typical filling to be. But the bakery offers so many other tasty treats that I can't knock them on their cannoli alone. They're well staffed and very attentive to their customers. They're situated off the road with a huge gravel parking lot, so you don't have to worry about trying to find a space -- pick up is easy.",5,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown

But, after 3 visits, I have tried several pastries and cakes and they are just ok at best and at worst kind of tasteless and spongy/heavy. The desserts are chilled and for some of them it makes them worse for the wear-- such as anything that is supposed to be flaky. Cute decor does not make up for mediocre sweets.

The High Roller Wheel is located towards the end of the Linq Walkway depending on which entrance you enter. It is right next to the parking lot.

Sprinkles serves Ice Cream, Cookies, and Cupcakes. You can go inside the store to buy your craving, but if there is too long of a line or you don't want to talk to someone, located next to the store is Sprinkles' Pink Vending Machine. You can buy cookies and cupcakes from the vending machine, but there's not a large range of flavors than ordering inside the store. My friend wanted a Cupcake for her break from work, so I went to Sprinkles. Unfortunately, there was a long line inside the store, but luckily the line at the vending machine had only one other customer. From the section they offered, I ordered the Red Velvet Cupcake.

Let me explain. I purchased a weekly special (parfait, $0.50 off). While purchasing, I informed the cashier that the amount she was telling wasn't the same amount the drive-through attendant told me. I got the trademark response. Without questioning her again, I bought it and went on my merry way. I wanted to double-check the price, so I called the next morning asking the regular price and weekly special price for comparison. Then I informed the incident to the person over the phone.

This is a fantastic ice cream place. The inside is incredibly clean and has a great decor. I sampled multiple flavors and they all were amazing.

"Found this place after eating AYCE Sushi. There is always place for desert with me. I'll let you guess how I found this place. It was via Yelp. I was towing a trailer with my car on it so it was a little bit hard to manuver around the side streets GPS was taking me but when I found it, I just parked it right in the front. Their lot was not big enough for my truck and trailer. Plus that evening when I went, it was packed. I got the peanut butter chocolate ice cream sundae with whip cream. Man it was good and rich. I loved every last scoop of it. The pricing here is fantastic. Its not over priced at all. I almost thought the price was wrong for a second but it wasn't. Other then that, I will be coming back here 100% when I'm in Cleveland and want pretty damn good ice cream I've ever had.",5,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown
"Save your money! I have heard rave reviews of Sprinkles cupcakes. I also watched every episode of Cupcakes Wars which the creator of Sprinkles cupcakes judges (now I think I will rethink her opinions). I got the cinnamon ""cupcake""...I use the term cupcake loosely since mine tasted more like a dense muffin. Even if I poured milk directly on it I doubt it would be moist. My friend ordered the vanilla cupcake with milk chocolate frosting, also nothing to write home about. Overall I was thoroughly disappointed since I LOVE sweets. There are plenty of other local cupcake shops that I would choose over this chain. If someone bought me another cupcake from Sprinkles I would try it in hopes of redeeming the name but I will not be spending my money on these MUFFINS again.

"Love this bakery! Amelie has 3 locations in Charlotte but this is the only one that's open 24/7. Here's several highlights about this bakery: The salted caramel brownies are delicious! This is one of their best sellers... and I'd say that it lives up to the hype. I had the rose eclair on my last visit and while it was good, it didn't beat the brownies. I've been to this location multiple times and there's always a line to place an order. My last visit was on a Saturday around 8:30PM. There were probably about 15 people ahead of me. So if you're looking for a grab and go experience, this is not the place. The ambiance is very whimsical and cute. I love it! They have plenty of seating. Lots of people seem to come here to work. I've never done it so can't testify to the quality of their wifi or number of power outlets... however judging by the crowd, I can safely assume they do pretty good job on both.",5,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown

Delicious cupcakes. Excited they finally opened one here in Vegas. This location as already mentioned in other reviews is located at the Linq. We stopped by on a Friday night. It was quite busy as one can imagine. The ice cream section was busier than the cupcake area. I got one cupcake (black and white flavor) and one doggy cupcake. Mine was delicious and I can tell my doggy enjoyed his as well. I will most certainly be back.

"I can't give my full support to a place that reeks of snobbery and unsatisfactory ice cream. Don't get me wrong, it's DELICIOUS ice cream. But, instead of saying, ""That hit the spot."" afterwards, I (and my comrades) always end up saying something more like, ""Well now I want a f*cking truckload of ice cream. Should I get the triple scoop? No wait, I can't afford it. Damn."" Here's how to remedy falling into the unsatisfied trap: Completely overdo it. By upgrading to an ice cream sandwich, or an entrÃ©e-sized sundae with three flavors of ice cream, toffee, cookie pieces, brownie bites, torched marshmallows, hot fudge sauce, and the kitchen sink, you'll not only leave satisfied (and slightly ill, in a good way) but you'll get to appreciate why the place constantly basks in its own glory. All of the toppings and ice creams are house made, gourmet and covered in glittering, artisan snob dust. When was the last time you had an artisan, snob-dusted blow torched marshmallow? The verdict? Go big or don't go.",3,Positive,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"AmÃ©lie's French Bakery was the place to be growing up in Charlotte. After a long night clubbing and eating too much cheese at the cheese and wine party, you tend to want something sweet at 4 in the morning. As big as Charlotte is, you'd think there'd be more 24/7 places. AmÃ©lie's has always been a staple delivering fresh handmade pastries, my favorites being the chocolate hazelnut tart and the salted caramel brownie. The workers are always helpful and don't mind telling you what things are. And after seeing the lines wrapped around the building, they still greet you with a smile. The only thing I hate is the parking, although it looks ample, you may be looping around a few times till someone leaves. This by no means will stop me from coming here or giving a 5 star.",5,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Negative,unknown,unknown

Two scoops is actually like one normal scoop anywhere else. It was kinda weird to me but they give you your ice cream on a plate.

I am typically not a fan of ice cream, but I have to say this was so good, I will definitely be back again! I highly recommend you stop in here and check it out for yourself. It's a very clean place and there are so many options when it comes to what you want. I want to try their strawberry cheesecake swirl next! Someone in front of us got it & it looked so good.

Also, I asked for extra milk in my cafe au lait only to be asked, ""do you just not want coffee in it?"". I don't get the elitist coffee culture happening.

"We taste tested 6 donuts. The grilled cheese and French toast were warm and delicious. None of the other donuts we taste tested were edible. By far Not the best donuts in the world........ Creme brÃ»lÃ©e was greasy, topping too hard and too thick, and cream was almost nonexistent. JJust about broke a tooth. Bought two because of the hype. Waste of money. If you're charging premium $$$$$ at the very least don't go cheap on the cream........ Bacon apple fritter was hyped. Horribly bland, almost no cinnamon and no apples. Horribly hard. Nothing was fresh. Everything was hard. Chocolate deluxe was all yeast with just chocolate on top. Nothing special. Wasn't fresh. Everything tasted like yesterday's donuts. And btw, we came early hoping to get them fresh for fair taste test. Last but not least, poor selection. More donut selection and much fresher at DD. Better value too.

I have tried several of the different pastries and desserts but I always end up landing back on the French Macaroons - my favorite: the pistachio (although I liked it better before they started adding the pistachio pieces on the outside, I think the extra baking of the pistachios changes their flavor). Anyway, I thought this was a great place to come and do homework when I was in graduate school, as it allowed for me to chill with my headphones or have group study sessions. The tricky part is timing. I have gone in with no line, and I have gone in other times and the line is wrapped into the other rooms of the building.

Yes I will give Amelie's five stars for their fresh delivery of their pastries. Salted caramel brownie is number one. However the sandwiches are pricey for 1 to 2 ounces of meat.

"I watched Christina Tosi as a master chef judge and was curious to try her desserts. Although the hype for this place is good, the prices are outrageous, however the quality is better than other dessert places I been to. And for the size of the dessert, it's a no go for the price. I got the bite sized cookie dough flavored confetti and it was really good, it was one of their truffles. The others were the cookies and they tasted kind of like any other cookie but with a different flavor than your typical cookie. The three cookies ran for $11 and the flavors were confetti, marshmallow and blueberry. The cookie truffle was 7$ and you get three small balls. It was definitely an experience that will be remembered. Was it worth the price tag? Hell No! But was it worth the experience. Yes! I would say give it a one time try and call it quits. I wouldn't go back, but the dessert is very good. Service was nonchalant. The employee that served me was kind of boring and annoyed about the pandemic, but pretty much everyone is.

Charlotte needs more asian fusion places if it really wants to be a diverse city so Matcha Cafe Maiko is a step in the right direction. Extra points for being in the suburbs so parking isn't hard. The matcha soft serve is premium grade- you can tell by the intensity of the color and how prominent the flavor is. Not a vanilla soft serve green tea ice cream you can get at a buffet but it ranks as high as Cha Cha Matcha in NYC. It packs a punch though so if you eat it on a weekend night expect to stay up for the next 6 hours. Also get the black sesame or hojicha ice cream, I actually feel like I'm in Japan. When I'm committed I will get the soft serve cone because they really top it high for you, but when I'm on the go I like getting the matcha float (they put matcha ice cream on top of matcha sugar water- it's good, I promise. They have a latte float version too but I can't handle so much dairy at once.) I wouldn't go there for the special though just because the way it's compiled makes it hard for you to mix the ice cream and the crunchy toppings. Anyway, was thinking of you Matcha Cafe Maiko so just thought I'd drop in and leave a review. Keep being amazing and come to the Triangle area thank you. Would give y'all 6 stars if I could",5,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown

"Although nothing bizarre, the conservative type flavors are still solid choices. My favorites were Italian Cherry and Cookies and Mint. Everything was good, but those two really stood out. The creaminess of the ice cream is key to the ice cream's success. The flavorings are also quite potent, which I like. Nothing breaks my heart more than mildly flavored ice cream. I wanted to try their shakes or sundaes, but I also needed to save room for elsewhere at the time. I did pick a pretzel cone for my scoop. The pretzel isn't bad, but it wasn't what I was expecting. Its not as crumbly as a traditional waffle cone. Its not necessarily as sweet either, but it does add an undeniably delicious saltiness to each bite.",4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Being from Youngstown, I was soooo excited to hear that Handel's was coming to Las Vegas. There is NOTHING like this here. DQ, Baskin Robbins...ICK. Ive had to settle for frozen yogurt. When you've had Handel's everything else mine as well be from the freezer section of the grocery store in a carton. Its just like home, stand outside and wait in line at a walk up window. I got my usual, a scoop of grape and a scoop of vanilla w oreo. YUMMY! Had some of Eds butter pecan....OMG so delish. The flavors are the same as Ohio (thank goodness). My reason for 4 stars is because the scoops seemed a lil skimpy compared to Youngstown which was a lil disappointing but my waistline thanks me :) Vegas....go treat yourself.

"After eating lunch at the Arrogant Butcher and a bit of walking around downtown Phoenix, me and my girlfriend headed back to her place in Scottsdale; but made a quick stop at Sweet Republic to satisfy our craving for something sweet. Upon walking in I had no idea just how famous this place was, until I saw a wall covered in press articles of recognition & until I saw the ""As Seen on the Food Network"" stamped on their menu for one of their ice cream dishes, the ""Toffee Banofi"" a double scoop of Madagascar Vanilla, fresh bananas, almond toffee brittle & salted butter caramel sauce. The interior is modern; slightly reminding me of Pinkberry and its modern decor. There is the counter that contains the ice cream, sorbets, and pastries. There are tables and chairs both inside and outside. There is a help-yourself water dispenser which came in handy after I got thirsty from eating 2 scoops of ice cream. There is also a stack of board games, near the water dispenser, to choose from and play with as you enjoy your ice cream at the tables. I admit that I'm boring when it comes to my preference for ice cream flavors. I tend to choose either vanilla or chocolate (or rocky road if I'm feeling adventurous). So surprise, surprise I ordered a scoop of their Madagascar Vanilla + a scoop of their Belgian Chocolate. You can definitely taste the quality and care that went into making these flavors. I personally preferred the Belgian Chocolate over the Madagascar Vanilla since the flavor was a bit more developed. I was able to sample the Horchata and the Espresso which were good but probably a bit too much for me had I ordered a scoop. Had I not been so full from lunch I would've liked to try the ""Campfire S'more"" a double scoop of Belgian Chocolate, roasted marshmallow & hot fudge in a waffle bowl but I suppose this is just one of many reasons to re-visit Arizona again!",4,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown
"I can't even begin to explain how much I love this place. Their baked goods are unlike any baked goods you've had before and I can promise you that. This location is new, but we used to drive all the way from Las Vegas to their location in Irvine, CA to spend $50 worth of stuff to bring home and snack on for a week. It was costly, but that's why I'm so happy to have a bakery so close by now. The layout of their operation is great too. No more waiting in line while servers rush to bring all of your items together. Grab a tray, grab some tongs, and pick up all the things you want, then bring the tray to the cashier for checkout. They will individually package each item for you if you're taking them to go. And every time I get to the checkout with a tray absolutely piled high with goodies, I'm always pleasantly surprised at how little it actually cost me. If you get the chance to try their coffees too, go for it!

"Presti's. We've been coming here for for over 25 years. Kathy has been coming here even longer than that (I think add at least another 20 years, shh). I think they do a very good job with lunch items and their prices are reasonable. Coffee is decent and the baked goods are worth the calories and the price point is fair. I have other places in the area that I like more for baked goods, deli food, and coffee. However, no one has a combination of quality in all three off those categories, plus price, and pretty fast friendly service. And the clincher for Presti's is atmosphere. There's an ambiance I can only describe as a little worn, a little chic, a little hint of Cleveland attitude (in a good ""it is what it is"" kind of way), along with a dash of theatre.

"Because I stayed at the Venetian, it was inevitable that I passed this place every time I left/went to the room. After seeing the good reviews on yelp I decided to give it a try. $17.50 or so for a box of about 6? A bit pricey, but what isn't in Vegas? Out of all the flavors, I liked only the espresso one. It had a good amount of coffee taste to it, but not overwhelming. The filling used for these macarons are not overly sweet which tends to be the case with most places. But basically, all the other flavors with the exception of chocolate and espresso basically tasted to same to me. And maybe it was a bad batch, but out of the 6, I think half of them were hollow in the middle. Which is not how a properly made macaron should be. The girl that helped us was a bit slow? But maybe it's been a long day. Overall, they're alright. Not the best I've ever had. But if you must try something, I would definitely go for the espresso.",3,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"Ice cream here is good but owners are NOT customer focussed. I have never been to an ice cream place that charges you ADDITIONAL charges to change the ice cream flavor on a sundae, until today. Very nickel and dime. I usually would not object to something like this, but they already charge very high premium prices, and it felt like buying a car with the upsell prices. When you buy one scoop of ice cream are the prices different for every scoop? If I want a scoop of Belgium Chocolate, the price should be less since the other flavors cost more to substitute, from the smores sundae, right??? First time I had ice cream and left with a bad taste in my mouth (actually in the end I left without ordering what I intended and went to Cold Stone).

"It was one of those nights when I wanted something sweet and cold, but I didn't want your average joe ice cream. I read about Sweet Republic in a local magazine and I couldn't believe a Cheese Course Duo ice cream was offered at the shop. It was a necessity for me to try it that night. I was the only one in the shop by the time I arrived, being close to quitting time but the woman behind the counter was extremely helpful. The first thing I wanted to sample was the Cheese Duo flavor. It consisted of Roquefort cheese and Medjool dates. It was intense, rich and very unexpected. It was delicious but I wanted something ""cooler"". Then, as I walked over to the sorbet area, the flavor, Mango Lassi, caught my eye right away. I knew at that moment, the Mango Lassi was my treat for the night. I was so sure of myself, that I didn't even sample it. Once I put the spoon in my mouth, my craving was fulfilled, and I was happy. Nice location, simple interior..i don't want to say Pinkberry inspired interior, but that's what it reminded me of. Thank you Sweet Republic. I'll be back.

"We came here for a sweet bite after eating across the street at Federal Pizza. The line was out the door, but no one seemed to mind waiting. I was too busy looking at all the retro candy from my childhood, so when I got to the front of the line...I had no clue what I wanted and didn't want to hold the line up. So, one of the gals suggested the Peanut Butter ice cream (score!) and the pretzel cone I had already planned to try...because...it's a pretzel and a cone! I loved the creamy natural tasting peanut butter ice cream, but the cone was a bit of a let down. It was a tad too salty and not light and airy like a regular pretzel. It was thick and on the crunchy side. So, I think I'll skip it the next time I go in. We enjoyed sitting out back though!

"I really like Milk Bar. I visited the Vegas location for the first time recently (previously I had only been in New York), and it's a cute little counter spot located in The Cosmopolitan. For those that don't know, Milk was created by Christina Tosi, who founded the dessert programs at the Momofuku restaurants. This makes Milk a huge draw for a lot of people (including me), so don't be surprised if you visit and it's packed. We lucked out and it was completely empty when we stopped by early on a weekday, so we had no wait and we were able to order quickly. On this visit I opted for a Cereal Milk Latte, as I had just had breakfast and didn't have room for much more, but Milk offers so much more! They're slinging some standard desserts including truffles, pie, milkshakes, cake, and cookies; BUT, they offer them up in flavors you're not going to find anywhere else. First, their Birthday Cake flavor is unlike any other. Why? I don't know. It just is. And it's delicious! Try the Birthday Cake or the B'Day Truffles. They also have Cereal Milk (like my latte) and the Milk Bar Pie (a.k.a. Crack Pie) is bomb! If you're in the mood to opt for a cookie, try The Compost Cookie, it's got a hodgepodge of mix-ins, and it's delicious! And this Vegas location has tons of alcoholic drink options as well. Milk is a bit pricey, and depending on when you visit there may be a line, but I honestly think the desserts are worth it. It's not fancy, so please don't expect that, but if you're looking for a delicious cake, cookie, or pie, then Milk Bar is your spot.",4,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Short Review: Donut Bar originated in San Diego and places an emphasis on fresh, tasty, picture worthy, and creative donuts. If a caked donut full of sugar is your thing, then give Donut Bar a try. Donut Bar is considered one the best and their customer service is excellent. Just be early because these donuts sell out fast. Longer Review: I remember the excitement when Donut Bar opened in Las Vegas. I'm not going to lie. I wasn't that excited when I heard the news. I didn't bookmark this place and had the opinion that Donut Bar was just hype. I'm originally from the 619 and remember when the first Donut Bar opened their doors in Daygo. I was one of those people that waited in line. The owner of that location was pretty cool and would walk by the line with full sized donut samples to patrons waiting to get in. Originally, I wasn't a fan. I had a few failed visits because their donuts were either out or I got something that was too sweet. I always picked a donut that just didn't ""wow"" me. I am also not into a cake donut with a bunch of sugar on it. I'm really boring when it comes to my donuts. I prefer a chocolate glazed raised donut, maple bar, cruller, or an apple fritter. That's all I really need or want when I'm in a donut shop. But when the girlfriend loves donuts, then you support her by eating donuts. I have been here a couple of times since grand opening week. I've tried the Samoa, The French Toast, Cake Batter, Caramel Latte, the Big Poppa Tart, CrÃ¨me Brulee, Matcha Cake, PB&J, and of course, the Homer. Their originality, freshness, and consistency stands out. I haven't had anything here that was too oily and greasy. Again, these donuts really do not appeal to me and in my opinion, just too sweet. But then I had their Caramel Latte. This donut is perfectly glazed with their latte flavor. Then a little whipped cream and caramel is added. Because this donut is large, the glaze and toppings do not give it that overly sweet taste. The texture is also perfect and not dry at all. This donut with a cup of their hot coffee equals perfection. I will cheat on my chocolate raised donut any day for their Caramel Latte. This donut alone made me a fan. 2017 Yelp Review #77",4,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"The macarons were pretty standard, and on the pricey side unless you get a 5 pack. Would give them 4 stars, but the first time we tried to go there, it was an absolute nightmare.

We arrived at that location 7 minutes before 9 (closing time) and the place was abandoned. We made it to the one facing the Strip about 3 minutes later just by chance and it was also closed. That location also opened late the next morning when we went back and I would have foregone the entire thing had I not wanted macarons so badly before my flight home.

"Now as a vegan, I wanted to write a new review to reflect my thoughts on Novel Ice Cream. I visited with some friends on Friday night. The space is really small and there were two people behind the counter serving samples, scooping scoops, and checking us out. With about 6-7 people ahead of us, It took about 15 minutes before we got to the ordering counter. We taste tested the two vegan flavors that they offered in the current moment - lychee and some sort of berry sorbet. The berry sorbet was VERY sweet, but the lychee was perfect! I shared a double scoop with my partner and added a single vegan topping. While the berry was overly sweet, the lychee was able to tone it down a bit. I believe they also offer a vegan sprinkle cookie and certain cereals as toppings! Maybe they'll make vegan doughnuts or offer more vegan flavors one day?? Know that there was plenty of street parking when we arrived. There was a scatter of people before our arrival. When we got our ice cream, there was a long line of about 15 people down the ramp! Timing is everything I suppose. Love the vegan offerings and will be back/recommend because of this!",5,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,Positive,unknown,unknown

"Donuts & coffee, the forever couple. This place gets it right in a cute downtown location. I went early afternoon on a weekday and there was still a good selection of a variety of flavors. These are really aesthetic ""crowd-pleasing"" donuts, I tried three. They're lighter (yeast-raised) than fancy donuts elsewhere, not so much the ""i had two and I don't need to eat again today"" I've run into elsewhere. The prices are also surprisingly competitive. Discounts for a dozen, and there were some basic bar-shaped donuts for just a dollar when I was there. This place won't break the bank.

Best cookies to order in my opinion are the compost and cornflake-chocolate-chip-marshmallow cookie. I honest feel like the cornflake is the best. If you have a craving for corn, grab the cornbread cookie. First time I had it, it hit the spot... Second time around it kind of tasted different. Hoping that that was just the heat and alcohol causing the difference. When ordering the soft serve, do yourself a got damn favor and get the crack pie with cornflakes... That shit is FIRE!

"Disappointed is my word for this location. I have visited the Fort Lauderdale location twice and have walked away raving about the food. When I saw that Las Vegas had a shop, I was giddy!! We took our, who was a first timer, into the shop as well and told her about all the yummy options!! I didn't want too much so I ordered 2 scoops of Cookie Monster with hot fudge. The server seemed to not understand my order but finally got it straight. It wasn't bad. For $8.99, it should be amazing, right? My friend ordered a chocolate milkshake. Again, a different server seemed to be lost on what to do. In the times of today where lots of places are short on help, I wasn't surprised. She also asked for whipped cream, which is an added charge. This shake took 5 minutes to make. Not sure why. And her whipped cream wasn't on it. She said something about it didn't taste right. We couldn't figure out what. My husband ordered the cookies with ice cream. It's our most favorite thing. He was extremely disappointed. The cookies were really hard and didn't taste fresh. The store was busy but the employees seemed off. There wasn't a lot of communication and the whole visit was just not what we had hoped. It felt messy in there.

"As I walked up to the window, the concrete floors were swept, and the stainless-steel countertops were, pun intended, stainless. The red, white, and blue color scheme occupied my line of sight. The pictures posted of the ice cream dropped my jaw to the ground and led a river to flow out of my mouth. The gorgeous atmosphere and savoring pictures give a warm welcome to anyone who approaches. However, the long line of desert hungry people awaiting to have their orders taken haunted me. I stood distraught at the idea of this long line starting at the window and ending at the handicap parking space. The waiting time just get up to the window was around eight minutes; this was a minor inconvenience that can later be redeemed if the ice cream is delicious. On my first visit, I was overwhelmed by the dozens of flavors mounted on the sign. I was taunted by each flavor. It felt like each flavor of ice cream was calling out to me to get a scoop. The multiple freezers you can see inside the store only make you wonder what flavor is hidden inside. Any concoction you can make up, they will probably have it. They had a variety of ice cream flavors such as Chocolate Malt with Caramel, Banana Nut Cake, Coffee Chocolate Chip, and Pistachio. Not only does Handel's serve ice cream, they serve sherbets, ices, fat-free ice cream with no sugar added, and low-fat yogurt (if you want a somewhat healthier option). The manifold of desert options given at Handel's flood your head as soon as you come face to face with the menu. The various ways you can get the ice cream served is also endless. You can get your ice cream served in four different types of cones, in a normal bowl, or even in a quart and pint. Your ice cream can also be made into different variations; they can be served as a banana split, a sundae, a hurricane, and as a popsicle. This variety, for both flavors of ice cream and ways the ice cream is served, really impressed me. Some ice cream shops I have visited just have a couple of tubs of ice cream and they have the option of it being served in a bowl or cone. The fact that Handel's has been able to branch out of being a traditional ice cream shop made me set it apart from any other ice cream shops. Once I got up to the window to order, I found the service to be mediocre, well at least from the person serving me. He greeted me and took my order, but what became prominent is that he did not want to be there, which is understandable. He did not receive me with a smile on his face and he forgot one thing I ordered. The waiting time to get the ice cream in your hands can also take a while as they have to walk away and scoop into a tub of frozen cream and sugar. I then got the ice cream in my hands. I got a tower of the Chocoholic Chunk and I tried Banana's Foster, Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, and Chocolate Peanut Butter Brownie from those I went with. My ice cream of choice was a chocolate party because the ice cream was very rich in chocolate and had chunks of chocolate all throughout. You had a chunk in each bite, and the best part was that the chocolate was not hard and chalky like the M&M's get in a Mcflurry. As I just got a lick of the three other flavors I can only have a minimal opinion. The Banana's Foster was a blast of banana with a hit of sweet caramel. The Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough had the same big lumps of chocolate and smooth indulgent balls of cookie dough all mixed in a rich vanilla ice cream. The Chocolate Peanut Butter Brownie had squares of chocolate rich brownies and scoops of actual peanut butter spread throughout the chocolate ice cream. The intensity of these flavors freezing our tongues made the wait worth it. If the ice cream is this indulging the prices must be outrageous as well. Each type of cone and bowl come with a price less than five dollars. Each of these cones come with a pile of three of more scoops making the price well worth it. The pints and a plate with four scoops of ice cream are also around five dollars. What I believe is a great deal at Handel's is the Two Buck Tuesday promotion they have every Tuesday. Any cone or bowl of ice cream will come down to two dollars each rather than four dollars. If you decide to go on a Tuesday, you better be ready for the long lines! The price point is perfect for a flavor packed scoop of ice cream.",5,Positive,Positive,Negative,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Negative,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown
"I completely forgot how awesome Batch was until a recent trip back to Madison. I was pleased that they finally relocated to the bigger storefront, which to me meant that they'd likely have more goodies to offer. I was not disappointed. I've had numerous great items in the past from Batch, from their baguettes to the popular monkey bread. One of my favorite pastries since I was a kid was the ""morning bun."" I was like a little kid in a candy store when I saw that Batch had one of their own on my recent stop. As what Corey D woul say, ""son of a batch!"" This big buttery ball of goodness topped with gooey caramel may have been one of the best morning buns I had ever eaten........believe me, I've eaten many. This one may actually rival Simma's in Milwaukee. This alone would warrant 10 stars, but damn Yelp only allows five!

Here's the down-low it took this owner 2 years, to find the perfect ice cream maker, and a year to perfect his doughnuts! So bottom line; the PERFECT doughnut is stuffed with perfect ice cream! Here's the scoop, there's 12 flavors of ice cream, handfuls of toppings, and cereal, if you choose, to top off your ice cream. I tried all flavors before deciding on what I think is the best combination in the world! Strawberry balsamic and a scoop of honey lavender! I kid you not, it's the best! My son got Cookie Monster stuffed in a warm doughnut, hubby got bourbon toffee with cinnamon crunch cereal stuffed in a warm delicious doughnut! This may sound over sweet, and stomach churning with sugar overload, on the contrary....it's not too sweet! It's perfected to be balanced, leaving you wanting more! It's magic, I don't understand it?

I can't say how totally disappointed I was in going to the Vegas location of Carlo's Bakery!! I don't gamble and I'm not into Blue a man Group so for me Vegas is visiting family and getting good grub. I love lobster tails and I'm not talking the fishy kind I'm talking the amazing east coast confection that is slightly crisp on the outside but soft and gooey and filled with a delicious custard.. unfortunately that's not what I got at Carlo's.!! I wished I'd have tasted one before I bought 7 of them to take home to friends.. well I couldn't wait so on the car ride home to AZ I dug in and wished I'd had a trash can to spit it back out.. it was awful hard beyond belief with hardly any filling and tasted so badly of old grease that I could only take that one bite.. I had my husband try another one hoping it was just the one and he couldn't take but one bite either.. the whole batch tasted like four day old leftovers yet we had only gotten them an hour before and we specifically got to the bakery early to get the freshest ones. Well I think we got the oldest ones they had.. not going to go back here maybe when we visit friends in Jersey we will try the original shop.. sorry Buddy this place was terrible!!,1,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

I'm also a huge fan of Matcha and I absolutely love their Matcha ice cream since it's not overly sweet. My latest addiction is their Ube Latte with Oak Milk. They have since added some pastry items to their menu and my favorite is the Matcha Cream Puffs. The store is really bright and clean. The staff is always friendly and so patient since I have a hard time making a decision sometimes. I love how you can order online as well.

"You know that random moment into an 8 hour round trip when it's 2 am and you need a bit of caffeine to wake you up but you refuse to drink McDonald's coffee? Typically you're bummed because no good coffee place is open. This isn't one of them. AmÃ©lie's is open 24/7, no matter what time they will always be a macaron (or some delicious pastry) and drink waiting for you there. The service is super fast as it is counter service with wonderful drinks like Rose tea or rose syrup in random drinks. They carry wonderful brands like Harney & Sons (which to me is great). They also have a mean chai and espresso. The service is super fast especially if you're like me and you're counting down the hours for when you'll come home. The art decor ;(sadly I have no pics), is very hobo chicish, old looking art such as Mona Lisa with hipster sunglasses, random shoes all over the place that remind me of the movie Marie Antoinette.

"Okay, so I may be reprimanded for this rating! I don't get how this is good 'custard'. If custard stands for froyo-ish ice cream then yes it's good. Good texture, stays cold, no overpowering flavour and just yhe right amounts of sugar. And the lemon one is the best flavour. But, IMHO, this is not custard.",3,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
Really cool spot. I tried the Campfire S'mores flavor - it was incredible! It even had a touch of smokey campfire flavor. Nuts! The building itself is a work of art and it's cool that you can watch them actually make the ice cream right then and there. Was worth the stop.

"Walking up to Jeni's I felt a sense of southern hospitality and charm. In the heart of South End, the location and ambiance is top notch. I was practically knocked over by the amazing smell as I entered the shop. Their homemade waffle cones are to die for! Literally the best I've had (and I love some waffle cones). They offer so many ice cream flavors. Some on the traditional side and some creative and unique. I love the gooey butter cake and the salted peanut with chocolate flecks. Regardless of your taste, there is something for everyone!!",5,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown
Mitchell's is one of the best ice cream shops in the nation! Whenever I try new ice cream shops I am always craving Mitchell's. The variety is perfect and the specials are always great.

"I was very happy this famous dessert place in New York opened in Vegas. But after trying the ice cream, I think this place is bit overrated. The milk soft serve with crunchy cereal add-on ended up costing me $7 something. I was like ??? at the moment because I couldn't believe I paid that much just for ice cream. The price might work for NYC but definitely not sustainable here. There's no line when I visited. The soft serve was good but I think the cereal was a bit too salty. I'm not sure if I will come back.",3,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"I tried to love it. I really did. So much so I tried it 4 times. Their cupcakes and cake slices are so dry. Each and every time. The frosting is so heavy! But this could be a personal preference. The frosting is very thick and taste like pure butter. Savory items are okay. Both items were bland and plain. Again, I tried to love it but I just can't. You can't go wrong with their croissants. Haven't tried their coffee. Three stars for friendly staff, great location, and super cute store. We need more of these please!",3,Negative,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"My sister ordered a key lime cake for my birthday celebration. The person who helped us when we picked up the cake was so lovely and the location is a cute, kind of cottage core style place. The cake was denser tha I had anticipated and had a more shortbread or pound cake thickness. Lime curd was tasty. All around good cake but would prefer to try something else next time. Would give a 4.5 if I could.",4,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown
"I could not get enough of this place! I've been to the original Milk in NYC, so I was hoping for a similar experience. I was not disappointed, the Vegas location tastes just like real thing! All the ice cream is made from cereal milk and it tastes A-MAZE-BALLS. With or without the cereal crunch toppings, this place won't let you down! Located inside the Cosmo, just up the escalator, it's in a great location next to many other food options. My only gripe is that it's a bit pricey, but so was the NYC locale.",4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown

"The first time I came here years ago I absolutely loved this place, but my most recent visit was lacking. It's a fun spot with a really interesting atmosphere and a beautiful display case of pastries. We got a myriad of treats to try and my husband also got a latte. I really wanted to try one of their lattes but can't have caffeinated coffee, unfortunately for me they don't have decaf espresso so I didn't get to try one. My husband really enjoyed his though. I tried a bite of nearly everything and it was all so sweet. I eat baked goods a lot so I expect them to be sweet, but these were so sugary I just couldn't stomach much of it. They were all good but far from the best I've had. The tables were littered with crumbs and hadn't been cleaned, which is a little off putting. The service behind the counter was helpful and prompt. I would say it's worth checking out if you're visiting and wanting to do something unique.",3,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"I mean it's hard to complain when it's ice cream.... Novel is a cute spot in a slightly hidden location. Although I do love the look and feel of the artsy/grungy sitting area -- very First Friday vibes. Novel is known for their ice cream between two warm donuts. I couldn't do something that sweet so I settled for a scoop of their lavender lemon. It was light and refreshing! I wish there were more flavors to choose from, I was slightly underwhelmed by their selection. But still a great late night spot in downtown.",4,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown
"The Crepe deserves 10 stars - it's as good as street crepes in Paris. It's the only one in North America which is. The service deserves minus 10. They're about as joyous as Thom Yorke Radiohead trapped in a Medieval Torture Device during a family bereavement. ""Crepes"" by Radiohead When you were here before The servers wouldn't look you in the eye They don't act like angels And they make you cry They ruffle your feathers They live in a gloomy world They think they're so special They're so f***ing special But they have crepes! And you're a weirdo! That's why you keep coming here! Even though they treat you wrong here I sang that out loud last time I was here. You should have seen the dirty Luxe I got. I'm giving them a 5 star rating despite them having the worst service - perhaps that I've ever experienced. And if you have a problem with that, I don't give a crepe. It's one of the worst customer service experiences of my life, but it's also the best crepe in North America, so I'm giving it a 5 when they deserve a huge 0 (a zero, not an O, no way) for the enormity of their attitude problems. What to get: Crepe with sugar and lemon. That's it. Nothing fancy. Trust me bae. What not to get: Angry when they treat you like a pile of horse sh**. These kind of Luxe might not be for Lorde, but they're absolutely for me. I'd say (and there is some decent competition in Philly and Indy among other places) that this is the best Crepe I've had in the USA. It's the most similar to France. Shame about the sh** service though. What a contradiction. We're talking about probably the best crepe and found in North America. I would know. I love this sh**. I go to France for this sh**. I know which alley in Paris the very best and most moist (moistmost) can be found in. I am the sh** when it comes to knowing sh** about which crepes are the sh**. Most Americans (I'm British, and we like talking sh**) grow up on sh** bland sh** crepes so they wouldn't know the sh**ting difference, would they? Like sh** they would. So these are the most authentic and traditional and true to the style of France. I think whoever started making these must have visited France a good number of times because this is almost the way they taste on the streets of Paris. Get it with nothing but sugar and lemon. That's the French way. In addition to being hairy and thin and making out a lot. With more than church tongue. On the other hand, we're talking about some of the worst service imaginable. I mean I've had so many bad service experiences here I don't even want to go into most of them. I can think of 5. I'll just tell you about one. Most recently I stood in line for about 10 minutes - about 5 minutes before closing - and they refused to give me a crepe. They weren't remotely nice or apologetic. I explained I was only in town from Buffalo once every 6 months, and that I'd just stood in line for 10 min, and there were still 5 mins to go. And they were passively aggressively complaining about people being in their line close to closing time and saying things like (loudly) such as ""I hope those people don't think they're actually going to get served"" and ""don't you just love when people feel entitled to get served after we're closed."" It wasn't just one or two comments. They were loudly giving sarcastic crap to their customers (particularly me) for a good few minutes, all the way not actually telling me directly, sorry, we're closed, come back tomorrow. They waited until the clock had ticked to closing time for that. Hmm, how convenient. I've written what, 5,000 reviews? Near enough. I don't think I've ever been served by people quite this rude. And consistently so. It's definitely in my 5 most offensive and ugly customer service experiences. So They get -5 stars for massive customer service problems and horrendous attitudes and treating their customers like sh**. On the other hand I'm basing my actual rating only on the taste of the wonderful Crepes so it gets 5 Stars although I do so with a heavy heart because they are absolutely awful to their customers particularly me but it's happened so often that it probably happens to others too and I bet they'd have way better ratings if they were even remotely nice or fair to the people paying for their products run on sentences ftw amirite. Anyway if you read this far, thanks for giving a crepe.",5,Positive,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

OMG! I Love this ice cream but after going there this evening and noticed that none of the employees were wearing masks or using gloves I will not be subject to irresponsible practices. We all need to be safe and courtesy of each other's health. You should also know that it is mandated by the Governor that masks are also required of your customers or they don't get served.

"I was very excited to try this place but it was not like I expected it to be. Seeing the long line I thought it would taste great, but once I entered the location, the bakery items looked very average. I knew by its appearance that desserts would not be what the hype was about but I really wanted to give it a try telling myself that something has to be great with everyone sanding in line for a treat. I ordered the most popular thing on their shelf and let me tell you, it was most definitely not good at all. I ordered 2 lobster tails, 1 strawberry shortcake and 1 chocolate hazelnut cupcake - $27 later I am left unpleasantly dissatisfied.

"A must-visit in Madison. It's a large storefront with few seats and many savory and sweet pastries. Their croissants filled with gruyere are literally the best croissants in Wisconsin. Their cheese crusted garlic bread sticks are large, greasy, and I have dreams about them. My favorite thing to do on the run is to buy one of their large bread balls with meat or bean filling. It changes daily - sausage, mushroom, and cheese; chick peas, pesto, and cheese; bacon, white bean, and parmesan. All amazing, though you'll need two to be full. I haven't even gotten to the sweets yet but rest assured that they're also all fantastic.",5,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

Aren't croissants a staple of French bakeries? 1 star off: No apology... 1 star off: No indication of when they will have a new batch... Just that there were no more croissants. I looked at the display case and there were only a few macaron flavors left as well. I like the Bouchon Bakery in Napa a lot, so I wanted to try this location. I just wish this location is better stocked, especially with the items that make it unique.

"Shame on me for not reviewing this place sooner! The Macarons are amazing here, they're so good that they're indescribable. I can't do them justice but I'll try. First of all, they're big and in this case bigger IS better, they're light, perfectly chewy and deliciously creamy in the middle. No other Macaron can compare, I continue to try others in hopes that they might be as good but I'm always disappointed. My absolute favourite is Raspberry, I've tried Chocolate, Vanilla, Coffee, Caramel and I think at one point they had Lemon also. The Caramel straight up had real caramel in the middle, making it extra decadent. They are just the most wonderful treat possibly ever.",5,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"Girlfriends would boast about Bouchon so this was my first shot of trying one out. Well, at least the bakery part. There's apparently 3 locations within the Venetian Casino, I managed to find two out of three. This one I found was near one of the hotel entrances. The line builds up quickly, so if you've heard of Bouchon or can smell the pastry, get in line! And no cutting!!!! Tried their regular and chcolat croissant---they nailed it perfectly just like the ones in Paris. Vanilla and chocolate eclair: so damn yummy. Each bite explodes of flavor, I'll leave that to you to think about. What they dropped the ball on the bread pudding. Way too much raisins jammed into the overly dry pastry that you end up building a pile of raisins as you rip through pieces of the bread pudding. Mind you, we got out pastries at 9am. Another note that if you order any type of drinks here on top of the pastry, you pay for everything, get the pastries up front...but the procedure on how you get your drink is idiotic. That definitely needs to be improved because not noting what they just made or even a name to a particular drinks= many pissed off faces standing by a counter that only lets one person get to it to get a drink.
