"The ice cream here is definitely tasted, but I think the ice cream is too melted. It has already melt down to my hand even before I went out of the front yard. I prefer something with more solid texture, but if you like soft ice cream, this is definite the place to go.",3,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"What a disappointment! We had dinner in the Venetian and did some walking around and shopping. I always develop a sweet tooth after dinner, we saw the Carlos Bake Shop sign and knew that was our next stop. It was across from Buddy V's Restaurant. The bake shop had a steady flow of customers. Even though it was late there was still a decent selection in the cases. We decided to get Vanilla cupcakes and a Creme Puff. The prices are pretty much on par with most cupcake shops/bakeries in town. The staff was pleasant and helpful. The Creme Puff was very small and pretty average tasting, had more whipped creme in than Bavarian creme. On to the cupcakes. Ugh! I have never refused to finish my cupcake until now! I LOVE cake, but this was horrible. Super dry with no taste, did they forget to add the vanilla?? If a baker can't make a plain vanilla cake then you have no business being a baker. The icing was pretty average but didn't help the cupcake one bit. The other factors in this visit saved them from getting a 1 STAR review. Skip this place if you are craving cake!! I will never go back.",2,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"So this is one I've been waiting for and I am excited that I get to finally review it. Ambiance: The decor is fairly the same as the ones that I have seen in California. I mean it is a franchise so no surprise there and no complaints. There's a good amount of cases for people to go to when choosing what they want to grab and the line weaves its way through. Service: Now service was good. There was a lot of people when I went so there was a bit of a wait but compared with the amount of people it definitely was not to bad. Service was fairly quick so no complaints. A girl named Kiara was our cashier and she was nice, quick, and when my mom asked if they had Taro bread she kindly offered to grab us a couple before it made its way to the cases which I did appreciate. Food: This is always the highlight. I never have any complaint and this is the same. My personal favorites are the Taro marble bread, egg tarts, and chocolate bread. The taro bread is always nice and subtle. Chocolate bread was good with some powder sugar on the top. The egg tarts are always a big one for me because the crust is always so flakey and the filling is sweet. A new favorite I've come to add is if you're looking for something on the savory side their Kale spinach danish definitely make my tummy happy. Overall, I'm glad we finally have one in our city. Only thing that I wasn't pleased with was the wait just because if you've been to other 85's then you know they're pretty quick but I'm sure they'll get faster once they fully settle in. In love and will be coming here a lot more in the future!",4,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown
"I have pretty high standards for cupcakes, as a friend owns her own cupcake business and hers are second to none. I've also had not-so-good cupcakes at another Sprinkles, so I was half hesitant to try this location. I'm glad I did. They really redeemed themselves. The last one I had was dry with hard icing. I had a pumpkin cupcake at this one and it was moist (sorry, moist-o-phobes) and the frosting, though thin, was rich. The flavor was spot on. While it wasn't nearly as good as the ones my friend makes, it was worth what I paid for it and it made up for bad experiences in the past. My husband had the chocolate marshmallow and said his was great as well, but his taste buds also might not be as discerning as mine! While it's not a necessity to stop here in Vegas, it was nice to have at the end of the night for a little sweet treat.",4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"Omg! This place is all of my sweet tooth cravings come true! I literally stared at the menu for about 5 minutes because I couldn't narrow down what I wanted- i wanted a little bit of everything! I did decide on getting a brownie sundae. I was able to choose my ice cream (I chose birthday cake) and my topping (I chose hot fudge). Yo, this did.not.disappoint! My fiancÃ© ordered the Yum Ee Bun with butter pecan ice cream! I tried a bite of that and it was delicious. I think it's one of their signatures menu items. They yum ee bun sort of resembles a donut without the hole. They cut a pocket into it and fill the pocket with ice cream. Amazing! My friend got a milkshake. They will add a yummy rim of the cup for an up charge (worth it in my opinion)! I tried hers too and it was so good! This place gets pretty busy so be prepared to wait in line for a little while... but... it is so worth it! If you have a sweet tooth like I do, stop into Ninety's!

"I've been here a few times and for some reason always hope it will improve. I love Cake Boss and admire Buddy and his team's attention to detail and love for baking, but this bakery is a huge disappointment. I'm sure the original in Hoboken is incredible but don't waste your time here. The cakes on display aren't impressive and look like anyone made them at home. The cupcakes are extremely dry and none of the pastries look fresh. There are two lines: one to order and one to pay and both are extremely unorganized. I just went yesterday for the first time in two years and realized it hadn't gotten any better. Hopefully they will eventually improve to the standard of what viewers expect when coming to this renowned bakery. Until then, I won't be back.",2,Negative,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown
One of the best ice cream I've ever had. We got there around 7:30 and the line was pretty long but we'll worth it. Also the line moves pretty quick. I got the mint and cookies with hot fudge and Oreo pieces. It was so good because they make it homemade so it's not very cold and hard. The staff there was nice too.

We got there around 9am and were able to get in and get out within 5 minutes.

"If you ever need a reason to visit downtown Las Vegas, look no further. Previously, I tried the lemon pistachio, apple-fritter, and maple donut. I was looking forward to getting the lemon pistachio but was disappointed to learn that they change the menu weekly. Today, I decided to try the Boston creme, creme brulee, Nutella overload, strawberry split, and caramel latte. I also got an old-fashioned donut which is a cake donut with sprinkles. What I love about these donuts is that it doesn't leave an oily taste on your lips afterward. They are so soft and fluffy on the inside and full of flavor. The cream in the Boston cream and creme brulee was not overly sweet and had just the right amount inside. I don't care for cake donuts because they are usually dense and heavy; I just wanted to try this one, and it was no different. The donuts are a little on the pricey side ranging from $1.00 with the most expensive being $5.00. There is construction going on in downtown Las Vegas. If you are coming from Las Vegas Blvd to Carson street, it's closed, so you have to go around the corner and come down on the road. There are about four street parking spaces located directly in front of the store.",4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown
"The best pastries in Madison, both in execution and in variety! They make wonderful breads, cakes and so much more.

"The infamous Cake Boss bakery! Well I've watched Buddy on the Food Network before but haven't kept up with his show in a while and never knew about a bakery opening here in Las Vegas until a couple of my friends were fond of trying out their bakery. It's located in the Venetian hotel right by his other restaurant. The line wasn't as busy as I would have thought but lines were moving smoothly and quick. There were so many dessert choices that we simply just came here for the popular recommended items which were the cannolis and the lobster tails. We got the original and chocolate canollis. It was different from all the kinds of pastries I've had so it was nice to try something new at a bakery. It was good but not enough to make me crave for more. It had cream wrapped in crispy shells. I preferred the lobster tails over the cannolis though. It's a flaky puffed pastry that was filled with cream. It was rich in flavor but it was delish! Although, the prices of these pastries would make me think twice about splurging on these dessert again. The cannolis were $3.50 a piece and the lobster tails were $5.95 each. These little things added up in total that I spent $50 to share among 8 people. It wasn't that the pastries we had weren't good, it's just that it hasn't lived up to the hype of what people portrayed or expect it to be coming from a big famous name company. It was worth trying though if you haven't had any!",3,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,Negative,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Churn is an extraordinarily cute Ice Cream parlor located right next to The Windsor. However, for the prices I was under the inclination I was having artisanal ice cream or something. While the ice cream itself was fair and admittedly very very fresh, the prices are a bit extortionist. They do have a lot of options to go with the ice cream, from customized cones to a variety of toppings but I truly do not think the ice cream was as expensive as they made it out to be. Also, for anyone that is curious at all, their rotational menu is all their flavors on rotation, they only really serve about 8-10 flavors at the location. You might want to call and ask what they have before you make the trek there or refer to the online menu, I *believe* it's updated daily.

"Went there for an inexpensive afternoon snack. Outside seating is nice - although it is right by a bus stop and the main street. Previous reviews indicated that it was a little gem within expensive restaurants. I couldn't disagree more. The ham and cheese baguette I had was probably one of the worst I have ever had. It was old, dry and rubbery/chewy. They did however offer to toast my bitten into sandwich. Bouchon quality for me means freshly made to order sandwiches and not pre-made old ones from the morning.

The flavor was recommended by the associate that was assisting us.

This happens pretty consistently during the weekend so I don't know why they don't just make more. Minus one star for the lack of customer service by the woman who works at the counter/picks up the phone Saturday mornings. She's pretty unfriendly and consistently has attitude when you try to place a hold order. She left me on hold for over 10 mins and clearly forgot about me until I hung up and had to call back, with no remorse.

"We came here around 12:30pm before closing. I didn't expect to buy leftover donuts but they were a great deal at the moment so we decided to fill the box up with $10. Half of the box were all creme brÃ»lÃ©e, the rest were weird unwanted assorted donuts. The donuts were cold, chewy and unappetizing. Maybe it was because we came late... I wasn't very happy but for the price, it was $1 per donut approximately. None of the donuts were that good, just taste like a regular mom and pop kind of place. I also got a Nitro infused coffee because the guy recommended me as something new to try. Pricey and wasn't worth it. The coffee was SOUR! I'm not sure if it's supposed to taste that way... I mean if you really put your mind to it, you might find it drinkable. I'm a huge coffee lover and it hardly got me to finish half after an hour of walking around downtown.

The ice cream was probably the best I have ever had; you can definitely tell it is homemade. We decided on their Lucky Charm ice cream was crazy good and got the fruity pebble macaroon, which was gooey and perfect in every way.

"I want to start off by saying I've never actually gone inside the establishment, but I follow them on Instagram and all the fitness models post epic cheat meals with these donuts. So~ when my friend went to Vegas, I made him bring home a dozen for me. Little did I know, a dozen would actually be 2 big boxes! It was totally worth making him lug it around though. Because these donuts were so bomb! We do not have anything like these in Philly. I mean a donut with a poptart in it?! Anyways, after cutting a piece of each flavor to taste them, I ended up freezing them because I couldn't possibly eat them all in one sitting, well I could, but I decided I shouldn't. Well let me tell you, have any of you guys tried frozen donuts before? It was probably even better than when I tried it fresh! How could that be possible?! Well some of the donuts were too sweet when I had it fresh (the poptart one especially) and when it was frozen it was the perfect amount of sweetness. I still dream of eating these donuts.

I live in LA, and I hope they will open one (or many) there ASAP, because it would be wildly successful, and I would eat there a ton.

"It was my first time to Melt. And wow! Most delicious, amazing ice cream...the Cookie Monster, oh my! However, I have to say the customer service killed my overall experience. Music was jamming with a line out the door, but once you got inside you weren't made to feel welcomed. The two working didn't appear to have any excitement serving the anxious and excited customers making the nights most important decision; what flavor?! They had their heads down on their phones for the majority of check out. There was no ""hey guys welcome to melt! Let us know if you have any questions."" Or ""thanks so much for coming in tonight...we'll see you back soon!"" ""Is this your first time in? If so we have punch cards."" The only conversation I had with the girl was ""make sure you bring your flight tray back inside."" My dad has owned a restaurant for 30 years and from my experience I have learned that customer service can make or break your overall experience. Those working for you are supposed to represent your business in the most positive way possible; you kind of expect that being in the downtown Roosevelt district where people represent a chill, cool, and friendly vibe. With all of that said, keep making delicious ice cream at Melt!

"My girlfriend was hungry for dessert after a D'Backs game on Tuesday, but it was almost 10pm. I wasn't optimistic we'd find a dessert spot downtown that late on a week night. But low and behold, Yelp saved the day and helped me find this place just a few blocks from my apartment. They've only been open about 2 months, but per the Yelp reviews already seemed to be garnering a fan base. The place sits in a historic home pretty much in the heart of First Fridays territory. In case you get lost looking for this place, just look for the neon ""Munchies"" sign. When we walked in it was just the owner (who also happens to be the owner of JoBot Coffee). Super nice guy. They don't make their own ice cream, but rather have it made by a local co-op. Their flavors range from Chocolate Raspberry to Chips & Salsa. After sampling seemingly every flavor, I went with a scoop of Cinnamon and a scoop of Vanilla Birthday Cake. When you order a cup as I did, you don't get a cup but rather a Chinese noodle box complete with fortune cookie. Random? Yup. But freaking awesome. She got the Chocolate Superfarm and the Raspberry. There's no seating inside, but there's plenty on the front porch. We were the only ones there (not surprisingly since it was so late on a Tuesday), but thoroughly enjoyed the ice cream and overall experience.

Cheese Danish - $4 - Thick and a bit to dense for me. Was not a fan of the cheese. Pistachio Macaron - $4 - Good crust and chewy body. Smaller then the napa one I had. Ton of pistachio flavor.

"Weight watchers beware, this place is simply full of sweets and fattening ice cream sandwiches! You have to admit though that it's a good idea to Treat Yo'self every once in awhile. For those occasions where only delicious desserts will satisfy, I couldn't recommend Ninety's enough! If you're familiar with the boardwalk in the university area then you probably already know where it's at. Park on the side closest to the Light Rail and look for the Chinese restaurant, it's across the walk from there. While there's not much to talk of concerning the decor, it is very clean and there's a bit of seating for people looking to beat the heat. It seems that they're banking on most enjoying their treats on the boardwalk, the rest of the building quickly fills up with excited families and individuals alike wanting a delicious snack. So as far as the treats, what tickles your fancy? They have macaron ice cream sandwiches, ice cream filled doughnuts, ice cream cake pops, all kinds of desserts. You can also get your ice cream in a cup or cone, but why would you? The couple of macaron ice cream sandwiches I've gotten here were outstanding and well thought out. They offer different flavors of macarons paired with specific ice creams and toppings. The team even seems to have a thing for cereals, and incorporates them into a lot of their products! I have to admit, I didn't expect the macarons themselves to be such a high quality product since they're being used in ice cream sandwiches, but I'd say these were excellent macarons. They could even stand on their own with a traditional filling if they chose to do so. Maybe something to consider! I'd love give 'em the perfect score, but last time they were out of a LOT of the specials. They were very accommodating with substitutes, for example they were out of the samoa macaron and just did a regular vanilla on my sandwich. My girlfriend also wanted the coffee ice cream sandwich and they were out of its 'biscotti' macaron so she had to settle for a substitute as well. All in all it they were out of 3 macarons, and 2 ice creams. So I hope that next time I'm able to try some of their named creations as they intended. Still, a very good package either way. Not a gimmick, and still going strong. Way to rock, Ninety's!",4,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive

They also usually have great music playing which earns extra points in my heart. When I go I always get the french press because I have gone a few times in the past where the drip coffee had been cold, so annoying. The pastry selection is overwhelming in a good way because everything seems to be good, at least from what I have had with the macaroons being my favorite.

The staff was very friendly and nice, and it's a teeny tiny little building but it's pretty hip, as you would except for the area.

The portion is pretty big so I suggest sharing! I got the dark chocolate cupcake with the coffee almond fudge ice cream. I wasn't a big fan of the cupcake... it was too sweet and it was more of a milk chocolate rather than a dark chocolate. The ice cream was pretty good though. They offer a mini size for the sundae, however, they only have limited flavors for the cupcake. I would probably opt for that one if I come back. You can seat your party outside because they have a few tables & chairs.

"Set Up = 5 Stars Service = 5 Stars Selection = 4 Stars Price = 4 Stars Peanut Butter Chip Cupcake = 5 Stars Carrot Cake Cupcake = 3 Stars I love the set up when you walk in. Ice cream to the right, cupcakes to the left. Heck, even a cupcake ATM outside. Just don't let size of this place and the lines fool you. Yes, Sprinkles is tiny, yes it's crowded, and yes they are quick/efficient. 5 stars for service that's for sure. I didn't try any of their ice creams, but that's happening soon. I tried the Carrot Cake and Peanut Butter Chip cupcakes. For those that know me, know that I love a good carrot cake and anything with peanut butter. So here are my thoughts on both.... Peanut Butter Chip Cupcake: This was so good, moist, had just enough chocolate, and packed with a creamy peanut buttery taste. I've had a few peanut butter cupcakes in my lifetime and would honestly rank Sprinkles near the top. If you're a fan of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, then you'll be a fan of Sprinkles' Peanut Butter Chip Cupcake. My only regret is getting only one. Carrot Cake: The icing was good, but thought that the actual cupcake could have been better. This was packed with a ton of carrots and a little dry. Again, I've had carrot cake cupcakes before and have yet to find one that I really like. Sprinkles didn't impress me with their Carrot Cake. But hey...it's all about their Peanut Butter Chip. If you're at the Linq, then I recommend that you check out Sprinkles and judge them for yourself.

Sorely disappointed. The hot fudge sundae was lukewarm at best and turned my stomach upside down. We tried to non pareils and the box didn't close and the woman at the front was flippant about it when we asked for a different one which she didn't and just stuck a sticker on it. And the box still didn't work.They haven't had brownies for 2 weeks but no where did they have a sign which indicated that. Only reason I gave 2 stars instead of one is that I like Ghirardelli chocolate but rest of the experience was subpar.

Affogato was horrible, as in, inedible horrible. Crack Pie is just like buttermilk pie, the Candy Bar slice was great but just so rich, malted cake balls were meh, couldn't detect the malt flavor.

"Believe it or not, there are some people who live in Vegas that think anything under 80 degrees is freezing. Wink wink! But if there's one thing that's going to get them outside to brave the harshest of frozen desert temperatures in the winter, especially if they're the Yelping type, it's ice cream. I don't know much about the history of Handel's, just mainly that they're from Ohio and people all across the country love them. This new location, while possibly different from others I've heard about, is completely walk up service only. It's located in a shopping center on the NE corner of Tropicana & Hualapai. And even with a space size that puts pretty much every ice cream shop in town to shame, there is absolutely no where safe from the elements that is customer accessible. Well, besides their own vehicles of course. With 5+ walk up windows preparing to operate during all business hours, there shouldn't be any problem getting you served up pretty quickly though. On the menu, you're going to find probably way more options then you'll know what do with. There's hurricanes, sundaes, parfaits, ice cream sandwiches, shakes...the list goes on! And if you just want a good ole fashioned scoop or two, there's about 40 or so different choices between the regular ice cream flavors, sherbets and the monthly special. I'm all for having options, but to be honest, there's almost too much here. It could be just be my indecisiveness kicking in, but it was a bit overwhelming. I will say this though. The 4 scoop sampler is one of the coolest things they offer, and I'd imagine it's got to be pretty popular. It's exactly what I ended up going with, and is a steal at only $4.25. It took a while but we ended up going with Banana Cream Pie, Buckeye, Chocolate Peanut Butter Brownie and Spouse Like A House (vanilla ice cream with peanut butter ripple and chocolate covered peanut butter pretzels swirled in). Each flavor was spot on with what they described and I'd have a hard time picking out a favorite of the four. The banana had a nice, smooth whipped cream type texture and big chunks of banana. The Buckeye had plenty of whole candies in it, which are basically like a big Rolo, but with peanut butter inside. And both the Chocolate Peanut Butter Brownie and Spouse Like A House had plenty of peanut butter flavor without having that terrible frozen peanut butter texture. All were a tad on the sweet side, but very creamy and delicious. The only thing I didn't like is that they all started to melt pretty quick, even in the January winter weather. I imagine during the summer, it'll be tough to finish before you have sugar soup. For being all window ordering, the service is very friendly. Each employee we talked to was very friendly and seemed to be quite knowledgeable about the products. With our visit being on the first day open, I think that's pretty impressive. Adding that to good quality products at great prices, I'll definitely be returning to Handel's!",4,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

I had the sugar-free, and I think the frosting was even better than a regular Red Velvet. My husband proclaimed the Salted Caramel as amazing, my daughter inhaled the regular Sprinkled- and we are saving the seasonal until tomorrow! (If we can.) I feel these are well worth the price ($4). Our cashier was fast and friendly, and encouraged me to join their rewards program, recommending I save my rewards points for ice cream, as it's more expensive!

However, the cupcake is a little small for the price ($5/cupcake) but other than that it is phenomenal. They have an ATM cupcake machine outside of the store which is really cute and fun to order through. But even better, inside they have a ton of cupcake and ice cream combinations to choose from as well as toppings. They cut the top of the cupcake off and put ice cream in between the top and bottom of the cupcake. It is a match made in heaven!

"My wife saw Milk Bar all over social media and had to try. Overall the presentation was nice and it is in Cosmopolitan, so don't expect decent pricing. We ordered the soft serve with and without the corn flake topping, 4 cookies, and the birthday cake balls. We were disappointed, all I can say is that it tastes like super salty dessert. Just overloaded with salt. We weren't expecting great things, but few things are more frustrating than paying a lot of money for bad food. The cookies and cake balls were ok, but again, too much salt and you can get better desserts else where in Las Vegas, like Crumbl or try one of the many bakeries in China Town. I'm giving two stars because the soft serve with the corn flake topping was good, but it was horrible without the topping. We ended up throwing away half of what we ordered, it was not good and waayyyyy too salty. If you like salty desserts, then by all means, but it wasn't for me.

Mitchell's has some seating available in their brightly lit shop and the line goes fairly quick. I'm pretty sure that everything Mitchell's offers is delicious and rich.

"I was so excited for Milk Bar's arrival. And, I was So disappointed. I got 3 cookies, a shake, and a soft serve ice cream. Everything was OK, but for $26 I expected to be blown away and I wasn't. There are off Strip places for way less money turning out a much better product. I wished that this location was more bakery and less walk up counter. I think when you SEE items in a bakery case... It's part of the experience. Everything here is already packaged to go or, with the frozen treats, you don't see them until you get them. Also, there is no seating anywhere. The Birthday Cake shake was tasty, but fairly small for $10. The soft serve cup is one size, but they do fill it up. I got the cereal milk flavor with the cornflake topping. It definitely tasted like it was supposed to which I enjoyed, bit the ice cream had a weird texture that was off-putting...like the cream was curdled or something. I threw it away about halfway through. Cookies was an OK size and a chewy texture, but 3 for $8?!?!? Completely overpriced.

"Some things are so good that it's wise you keep it at arms length. I'd have to say that Amelie's falls into that foodie category. Between the pastries, eclectic crowd, creative decor and 24-hour access, I'm pretty sure I'd be a blimp if I lived in N. Davidson! I'm visiting Charlotte this week and hanging with the TonyaP so I knew this place HAD to be good. We popped in last night and there was a line snaking in front of the counter but not to worry, it moves quickly. I stuck my head into the side room and was amazed at what I saw: antiqued furniture, high ceilings and lush fabrics. Everything at Amelie's falls under creative, shabby chic! Loved the overhead light piece shrouded by stainless steel cups, graters and other kitchen items. My eyes immediately got drawn to the lit pastry case where my visual tummy was dazzled by the array of delectable sweets. Pecan pie, fruit tarts, napoleons, eclairs and more, me wants it all! I took it ""easy"" ordering up three items and everything was boxed up for us. But if you know Tonya or myself, we are NOT gonna wait. Plopped ourselves down on some stools and dug in. That pecan pie was wonderful, full of nuts to counteract the rich, sweet filling. And a great sweet crust that wasn't over-baked. One of the best pecan pies I've had since it was more nutty than usual, I tried to hog it all up but shared a bite with my Yelp host. I was buzzing with the sugar so I wisely held off on the peach tart and sea salt brownie until laters... Seriously good baked goods, there's a lot of love and talent being placed into their product here. Update: Finally ate the sea salt caramel brownie and it was UNBELIEVABLE! What can I say but Amelie's rocked it out for me! This bakery would do well in any urban center including San Francisco, call me impressed. So Charlotte, enjoy Amelie's for everything it's got. I for one am totally jealous that you've got this amazingly tempting bakery here. Thankfully I'm 150 miles away, Amelie! We'll have to have a long-distance relationship, girl...",5,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown
"If you're drunk, wandering on the strip, these goodies will probably be the most gratifying things ever.. other than Yoshinoya! It's a fun and trendy chain but this popular cupcake spot has only been ""okay"" for me. I've tried several of their flavors but the ones that stuck out was the Triple Cinnamon and the Banana. The taste and sweetness is fantastic. The cake has a consistent moisture and the frosting is thick! However, I was not THAT impressed.. I've had much better cupcakes at small mom&pop bakeries. At about $4 a cupcake, I expected much better. For quick, convenient cupcake service, Sprinkles has an express cupcake ATM(w/service charge) located outside of the shop. It's such a neat idea, it's hard not to try it.. or at least Instagram it. haha What I was looking forward to was their icecream. But yet again, I was heavily disappointed. I ordered the Red Velvet icecream with graham cracker crumbs. I don't know if my sweet tooth malfunctioned that day but the entire dessert was bland. Their red velvet icecream is basically a sweet cream/vanilla with red velvet cupcake chunks in it. I had bites that had big chunks of cake and graham cracker, but still was not getting that sweet satisfaction. I'll definitely come back again to try different flavors and hopefully re-rate this shop higher.",3,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

It was okay, I've had better. It was $10.00. I also bought a mug for $10.00. They put them both in a white plastic bag that said Thank You like you get from Stop and Shop. Very embarrassing having to walk around a beautiful hotel like the Venetian with a Stop and Shop bag. When I met up again with my other family who went on the Gondola ride, one of my couisins said ""Gee, you would think they would want to give you at a bag with their logo on it.""

"With so many 5 star reviews this place caught our attention. On a recent trip to Phoenix one night we decided to have ice cream for dinner. (Try it sometime!) We loaded up and made our way to Novel. It's in a nice, working class neighborhood with well maintained houses just off 7th Ave. it's an area quickly gaining a good reputation for innovative and high quality dining choices. As soon as we walked in we were welcomed by Brandon who told us about their ice cream, the awards they've won and what they are most famous for: stuffed doughnuts. After my family and I tried several samples we each chose a different flavor and a topping for our stuffed doughnut. It's a glazed doughnut without the hole that is used to make a sandwich for their delicious, creamy ice cream. The food alone was worth a 5 star review. But I wish I could give it 6 stars because Brandon and the two helpful and charming young ladies that helped us were warm and friendly and made us feel so welcome. I travel to Phoenix several times a year but sadly this was my first time coming to Novel. Don't repeat my mistake. Of all the places I've been in Phoenix this tops the list of must sees when it comes to dining.",5,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive

"We have been wanting to try Jack Frost Donuts for quite sometime now - so yesterday we made it happen! We had to take a friend back to the airport and thought after all we have read about them that this would be a perfect place to eat away our sadness :-) Jack Frost offers raised and cake donuts. We had to ask the lady at the counter to tell us what our choices were as they are not labeled. She did an OK job but she did not really ""sell"" me on any really. I would have thought me saying it was our first time she might have been more helpful but she wasn't. She did not even point to what was what as she rambled off their names. In the end we purchased a mixed dozen and a half in order to sample a variety of styles and flavors. We had some lemon, some turtle, some salted caramel, some maple bacon, some of their cream sticks and some krullers. I am not usually a fan of a cake donut but theirs are different than most. When I normally eat a cake donut they are very heavy and crumbly but these had a bit moister consistency to them. I tried the Salted Caramel and it was not super sweet - just enough icing to give it a little flavor. I would have like it to taste like caramel but it really did not. It did have a bit of salt flavor though. The Maple Bacon was delicious! The icing is really delicious and the bacon had a great flavor and not just like bacon bits being used. It was the one donut out of all of these I think I would want again. My husband and my sister each had a lemon and they said they were good but nothing as special as we had hoped. I was most disappointed in the cream sticks and Neapolitan we got. The fillings used are very grainy and not flavorful in my opinion. The worst one being the peanut butter. It was overly grainy and way too sweet. We also tried their turtle cake donuts and they were not too bad but the chocolate creme on one of them was lackluster. It was a great idea but there was not much chocolate flavor to it so it fell short of its intended goal. The one without actually tasted better because of this. I really wanted to like this place I had heard so much hype about it, but all in all it was very average. I might try it again just to see if it was an off day...but only if I am on that side of town for something else.",3,Negative,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

I'll update my review after they open to the public Update: 7-30-18 I came here over the weekend with my fiancÃ©. We really enjoyed the goat cheese and cherry.

"Milk bar is a little expensive for what it is but I expect most places on the strip will charge more. We wanted dessert ASAP and decided to swing by this place. There was a line but it moved quickly even with only one person working. We both decided on shakes, I got the chocolate cake shake and my husband got the birthday cake shake. There's sprinkles all over the top and chunks of cake mixed in with the ice cream. It was really a perfect amount and didn't feel as heavy as your typical ice cream shake. They were so yummy. The straws were nice and fat so you could suck up all those cake chunks.

"I can only write this review for the ice cream side of this place. When we went here there was a crazy line outside the door where a bouncer type worker was only letting a few people in at a time. As you waited (and waited some more) you could peruse the menu. I noticed that most flavors were only available certain days of the week and a handful of flavors were available every single day. I guessed that these were very popular flavors and when I heard they would let you try two flavors I decided to test my theory out. I tried Rocky Road which is my go to flavor but when I tried SALTED CARMEL something magical happened in my mouth and brain. When I think about it now, the name SALTED CARMEL requires me to type in all caps, but what I really want to type is SALTED MUTHA EFFIN CARMEL. Holy Samoan on a tightrope batman! This flavor is the bizness. So much so that I went back less than 48 hours later to bring a friend to try it and have another magical dopamine firework show go off in my brain. The second time I felt like a big piggy for being there again so soon so I asked for a kids cup size and they really tried to convince me that it would be too small. I stuck to my guns and was glad I did because it was the perfect size. Thankfully this place is on the strip and not right near my house. If you're at the Linq you should try this place and the SALTED MUTHA EFFIN CARMEL ice cream. You'll be thanking me and hating me at the same time.",4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

On this visit my lunch companion and I shared the Caramel Cashew ""God Bless You"" and the ""Thick Ol' Fashion Chocolate Milkshake"" and both were delicious. The ""God Bless You"" was the perfect mix of Vanilla & salted caramel cashew ice cream, caramel topping, topped with cashews, whip cream and a cherry on top.

My favorites are the chocolate ones. I think they have one called triple chocolate, and for chocolate lovers out there, this is definitely one to try. The ice cream is really good too. I tried the milk cream with cornflake crunch and I was blown away. Before trying the ice cream, I thought it was just vanilla covered in the Corn Flakes cereal. I was sure wrong. The ice cream was very delicious and not too creamy. The flakes are what make the ice cream, and they give you a healthy amount. Each bite you take is filled with bunches of flakes and they even give you a good serving on the bottom of the cup, so you aren't stuck with just the toppings on top. The flakes are very savory and each bite is filled with bits of joy.

"Campbell's Popcorn Shop is the latest food destination I'm recommending to people. Usually it goes ""OMG. I wish I had some Dichotomy Mix right now!"" It doesn't matter the time of day, or if I'm hungry. I just love the cheddar/caramel corn mix. People usually say ""Wutch you talkin' bout, Willis?"" and then I tell them all about Campbell's. I like that I can try any flavors from a neat little vending sample machine from the counter. There are also chocolate creations like turtles and peanut butter cups. You may purchase your popcorn by regular or large bags, or tins! I made a special trip on Saturday to Ohio City just to stop and get a couple of bags of the Dichotomy for double booked Saturday parties. I love it when you introduce people to a superior food product and you can literally see the moment while they're taking their first bites and they realize it is superior. I had several of those moments on Saturday night. So far, no matter how good the other flavors are, and they are all good, I have only bought dichotomy.

"It's hard to find real ice cream in the valley. There are hundreds, if not thousands of frozen yogurt spots, but real ice cream really is rare. After reading some interesting articles on Sweet Republic, we finally decided to drive on down to Scottsdale and check it out. It''s in a strip mall (of course), and the interior is pretty cute. Modern and clean. Plenty of tables to enjoy your ice cream, and a few scattered outside. Their ice creams are made in house, in small batches, with local, all natural ingredients.

"AMAZING doughnuts for vegans and non-vegans alike!! I'm usually out of town on the weekends so my mom waited in line for about 30 minutes yesterday morning to get us some doughnuts. It was well worth it. We got the key lime pie, glazed twist, blueberry cake, strawberry shortcake and raspberry lemonade. The blueberry cake was my personal favorite but I'm also partial to cake doughnuts but it was delicious and not super oily or overly sugary. The perfect cake doughnut. My mom and aunt loved the key lime and strawberry shortcake, some of the best doughnuts they've ever had they said.

Also, we all know that the best part of cereal is the milk at the end, right? When you walk into the shop, you are greeted by the fun cereal boxes along the wall/shelves and the neon lights. The menu has a lot of unique offerings in addition to the ability to create your own mix. You can also opt for a milkshake or cereal in a bowl. I always opted for the milkshake, and I personally think that is the way to go. I was able to try the cosmo and Wanda, Scooby snacks, and mucha lucha. My favorite was Cosmo and Wanda because I love fruit loops and captain crunch berries. This place makes you feel young and alive. It brings back good memories of childhood.

"It's not healthy, and they aren't trying to hide it. The ice cream is actually quite superb. Loses 1 star for the usually dismal service, amount of eye rolling and just general lack of caring by staff. I'm not sure if this a managerial problem, but many times the place will be PACKED and you will have one person tending to customers, and the other one will be making ice cream sandwiches or something equivalently unnecessary (when you can see a refrigerator full of sandwiches that are not being eaten). You can ask to try the ice creams, but don't expect them to be happy about it. I've taken to not getting ice cream anymore and ordering the chocolate covered frozen banana. It's still really tasty and I assume a little bit healthier?",4,Positive,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown

I came across this after eating some poke at the same plaza. The brightness and the decor caught my eye. After looking at their simple menu I understood their concept. I chose fruity pebbles for the milkshake mix in and that nostalgia hit me. Oh those kids memories! The milkshake was flavorful and soft. I had a sample of their matcha late and it was on point: not too sweet and strong matcha taste.

We walked around at least twice before started to pick out our goodies to take home... The shop itself was very retro and clean... the set up was very easy to follow and well set up... all the staff was busy hustling around stocking, cleaning, or helping customers... For a weekday in the middle of the day was pretty busy but the shelves were constantly being refilled... i had the bacon buns which was really good the bread was so soft and the bacon made it so much more tasty... i also had the strawberry shortcake it was so light and dreamy with the fresh strawberries... yummy!

It is much better than cold stone creamery. It's around $7 for a cone or milkshake. They also have boba and fresh matcha tea. I'll have to try that next time. The strawberry shortcake was definitely my favorite, they placed fresh slices of strawberry on the side with sprinkled cinnamon crunch on top. It was a good size, almost too big to finish.

(you have to understand that i'm judging based on all of my ice cream experiences... comparing w/ Bi-Rite Creamery, Humphrey Slocombe, Scoops, and myriad other ""gourmet"" ice cream shops). as far as my AZ ice creamery experiences goes... this is pretty up there. i think what stands out about churn is that it is clearly HOMEMADE. and i mean that in a good way. you can tell that they haven't industrialized or lost any of the ""made with love"" touch. which is nice! and different! the main drawback of such a small business is there can be a bit of a wait if you come in with/after a large group. and by large i mean 4 orders of ice cream. we were that large group. oops. summary: Churn is the PERFECT ending to a great dinner at Windsor. support local small businesses!!!",3,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"I was really looking forward to trying Milk Bar, but to my dismay, it really wasn't that great. It's not even that the prices are ridiculous or anything; the sweets just didn't live up to the hype. When we went around 1:30pm on a Sunday, there was about 10 people in line and it didn't take too long to get to the counter. They ran out of a few of the popular cookies so we ended up getting the crack pie, corn cookie, blueberry and cream cookie, birthday cake truffles, and the cereal milk soft serve with cornflake crunch. The crack pie was way too sweet for my taste, though I enjoyed the consistency of the pie.. The blueberry and cream cookie was kind of oily, and the corn cookie was pretty good. I only had a bite of the soft serve because I was so full, but my first impression was slight disappointment and that I've had better.

My wife ordered a croissant and a overpriced $4.50 lemonade. Simple enough. I ordered an $8 chicken sandwich on a baguette. Sounded great. Didn't come with anything. The guy at the counter asked us to step aside and wait for my sandwich which he said would take 5-10 minutes. I thought I heard him incorrectly. Just do the math in your head to build a sandwich with 4 ingredients. The restaurant was dead. 15 minutes later my fancy French sandwich came out. It was tiny and the chicken was thin grilled pieces.

"Jeni's is ALWAYS on point. Midwest grown and slowly making its way from coast to coast! I first heard about Jeni's several years ago when I met a girl from Ohio when I lived in San Francisco. We became friends and both being from the Midwest we shared some of the things we loved and missed... one of those things for her was Jeni's ice cream! So you can only imagine how excited I was when I was living in St. Louis a few short years later and they opened a location. It was as good as my friend hyped it up to be!! Sadly (well not now, but at the time) I moved to Charlotte and there was no Jeni's. SIGH. Fast forward a year and a half later and BOOM! Jeni's has arrived! I couldn't wait to get in line and once again see if it lived up to the hype... which it did! The flavors are so unique and delicious!! Since it's summer they ended up having a few seasonal flavors, one of those being frose!! It was a delicious sorbet type treat and the one I ended up going with! That is after I tried half the flavors! Again, this isn't your normal ice cream shop and you should enter with an open mind and empty stomach! They'll let you try as many flavors as you want, don't be greedy though, if you find what you're looking for (or if your stomach is telling you yes) GO FOR IT!! They do half scoops which are comparable to a small/kiddie scoop at a regular ice cream shop. $4 for a scoop or three for $6... no brainer, go for THREE! And don't forget fresh, homemade waffle cones or waffle pieces come with every scoop!! If you're looking for that cool delicious treat for your summer evening, hop on over to Jeni's!

Ive never had a macaron before so this was my first time and i loved it! The toasted marshmellow was to die for.. the outter shell it made and breaking it open to find the gooey fluff just ooze out. Ugh, perfection! I could have had 4 of those on my ice cream and i would have been good to go. I will say they are a bit expensive. Mine came out to $8 which, the ice cream was good, but i dont think its good enough for $8..

"Ninety's has SO much hype around it and it's been on my list all summer to try it out. Its University location isn't the most convenient, but I finally made it up there. I'm glad I tried it, but I can't say I walked away thrilled. To be fair, I am not very interested in their specialty treats - the macaron ice cream sandwiches or cookie dough pops.I just tried a good old-fashioned waffle cone with two flavors - moose tracks and some peanut butter pretzel something (the scooper mumbled the flavor name and I heard peanut butter so I went for it). Both flavors were solid - the moose tracks had an insane amount of fudge in it (delicious but honestly a little too much for me) and the peanut butter element of the other flavor was just enough. My friend got the brownie milkshake which was definitely underwhelming. If I go back, I'll try a more exciting milkshake with the edible rim. Otherwise, Two Scoops still wins best ice cream in Charlotte. I gave them four stars for their unique offerings in which I happen to have limited interest. There's gotta be hype for a reason, right?! Note on the location: the shop is located in a large shopping center and parking is somewhat of a nightmare. We went at 8pm on a Friday and it took five minutes to find parking. There was no line when we walked in but there was a long line when we left. Expect this place to be ALWAYS busy.

Because they are so soft, they can get squished!!! A big fat duh but still. Some people's children y'know?? The compost cookie though... I heard it was good but I am not the biggest fan. It's good but not omg amazing. Their version of a White Russian? Like I said before. WOOOO. Make sure you mix that baby up good before, during, and after you drink it because that alcohol SITS.

It's one thing to have cute and creative donuts but the most important part is that it has to taste good as well. I wanted to try the pretzel shape donut, but I didn't see it when I got there, so the the worker told me about a french toast donut that was made fresh. It took about several minutes to make, and it tasted just like what it was called a, ""French Toast Donut"". It was literally a french toast donut. I also ordered the bitrhday donut with oreo inside and a glazed buttermilk for my boyfriend. All the donuts we ordered exceeded or expectations.

"Why oh why didn't I look at Yelp before coming here. Perhaps because the smell off freshly made crepes was enticing. We stood on a fairly long line with a gal, bun in hair, ring through nose and a nasty attitude. Not ,""may I help the next person?"", but what do you want and move down. Doughy tasteless crepe with green bananas. You can't mess up nutella so that saved it. She put the topping two inches away from edge so you just had one mouthful of dough after the other.

"I'm going to start this off by saying this is my temporary review of Donut Bar. It's October 2nd, 2019, and after an accidental overcharge this morning, I'll be visiting again several weeks from now for some complimentary donuts per the owner and employee named Olivia. I basically only review donut shops. I literally start most days with a donut and coffee, typically a maple bacon variety. I hope my first experience here was just an outlier, and next time is more enjoyable for me. I gave a star for presentation alone, and a star for the fact my sister loved her vegan CrÃ¨me BrÃ»lÃ©e donut. However, I honestly can't give a star for my Brad Fritter. It was almost flavorless at times. I went through large bites of nothing but borderline undercooked dough; which I spit out. It was rather unpleasant considering what I was anticipating. The fritter itself lacked any real sweetness, for such a large and doughy item, it just didn't work. The only sweetness was from the maple glaze; which I was searching for, because it was delicious when present, but it was scarcely drizzled. The item suffered because of this. There was definitely a generous portion of bacon, but again the fritter truly lacked that sweetness to balance that savory. More maple drizzle or a glaze would have done wonders. I might have even powered through the doughy parts. I only ate the bacon and crispy exterior. When I return I'll prob just try the maple bacon bar, or something seasonal, assuming they honor the free donuts. Cheers to second chances in a few weeks or so!",2,Negative,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Extremely hard to find. It's located under an escalator at a dead-end area of the casino. Unless you walk all the way to the front door of the Venetian theater and turn around (it'll be behind you) then you could easily spend 30 minutes searching for it (like I did.) Another reviewer said it's near Lux Cafe...not really. It's a good bit away from it. The casino signs for it stop when you're still too far away to find it, and casino staff seemed not to have heard of it. I asked two - one sent me to the Lux Cafe bakery; the other tried to send me to the restaurant, which is located on another floor. Fairly pricy. Service was average; staff let a drunk woman cut in front of me and said nothing about it. They got my order wrong, but fortunately I checked my bag, and they did fix it when I asked. But the biggest reason for 2 stars: Seriously underwhelming pastry. I ordered a macaron, TKO (Thomas Keller Oreo), a bouchon, a croissant, and a mini almond loaf, and coffee. The only things I would have ordered again are the coffee (not exceptional but good) and the almond loaf, which was quite tasty if not ideally fresh. The TKO was decent but too sweet - that white chocolate ganache didn't blow me away. I'm pretty damn sure that everything except possibly the TKO was not baked that same day. I went around 11 AM; perhaps things are better/fresher earlier?",2,Negative,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

Awesome ice cream alert! I love that Honey Hut makes different flavors throughout the year. The seasonal fall/winter flavors are my favorite! This place is a hidden gem. Just walk up and get whatever ice cream you have a taste for and then grab a seat on the nearest picnic table. In the summer this place can get packed!

"After seeing other yelpers checking in at this place, we figured we would give this place a try on a Friday night. For ice cream, it is all vanilla base. Then you pick a flavor, a topping and an ingredients and they will create one just for you. You have a choice of having it on a waffle cone or a cup. I picked the waffle cone (and I regret it later because it was too much and messy). They also sell unique drinks that I would like to try next time. Since it was my first time, I ordered one from premade menu (I think it was called Oreo something). It took them at least 15 minutes to make the ice cream, but we did not mind to wait since it was a Friday night. If you want to go in and out of there, just keep that in mind. I also tried a sip of the Strawberry Macha Latte. It has a unique taste to it, but I am not sure if I would order it for me.

You're only well known for these things but whatever. I asked the cashier after buying some cookies since we were waiting so long when he recommends coming back for them and he said...8 am is the best time when we open. So here we are at 8 am only to be told that ""today they are only serving it in evening!"" Three things: 1) let people know when they are waiting in line when something is out... 2) train your staff on being accurate and truthful on your bakery and when things are available 3) really?

The cafe has an old world feel. Think a dark Viennese cafe. I made my way to the counter and saw so many beautiful cakes. Alas, cakes aren't practical for grab and go errand type. The brownies were huge and would fit the size criteria of a shared treat. Then I looked up and saw what I thought were whoopie pies (gobs for Western Pennsylvanians). I read closer and they're cookies with peanut buttercream filling. Done! We sat on the bench outside and shared the tasty treat.

The Ohio City location is cool. Nice and roomy and bright, and the train that goes around the restaurant is soothing. It is best to go to the second floor, where you can watch them making ice cream.

There isn't a line for anything, so you really need to pay attention what they're calling out. Ended up being around $25 for those three items. Lobster tail was eh, cream was bland and the pastry was crispy to the point where it was hard. California cheesecake was nothing special or unique.

If you go during the day, the line up is pretty long, so go in the evening and you'll wait less. The service was good and the staff was courteous. Location is pretty clean too. Bad: I've gotten 2 cannoli, one dipped in chocolate and one regular. The chocolate one had a dry and waxy taste, which wasn't awful but wasn't pleasant neither. It just didn't taste fresh. I've had better cannolis from Italian pastry shops back in Montreal. At $4 a piece, it's still pretty hefty for a mediocre pastry. Bottom line: me thinks not. I don't think I would go back and wait in line again.

The macarons are large in size for $3.50 and didn't have an eye popping flavor or bite to it. I prefer Paulette's up in SF. The cupcake was in cool temp that the cake was stiff and the frosting sucked. Something unique with it was the inside filling of cream cheese. It compared to whole foods cupcake lol.

We got quite a selection of baked goods, and would order most again. We had some macarons and a salted caramel brownie at the actual restaurant. We both loved the pistachio, but the orange and lemon tasted a little bit like Fruit Loops and seemed stale compared to the pistachio. We took home a box full of goodies (another brownie, an eclair, a chocolate croissant, two more macarons, and a petit four) that we ate over the next couple of days. All were delicious. Peter said the eclair was exactly what an eclair should be. My favorite was the salted caramel brownie, it was heaven.

If you're looking for a cake, the Italian Wedding Cake is marvelous. You can get cake by the slice or order an entire one to take home -- they've got a ton of flavors to choose from! I also love the pastries, like the turnovers and chocolate croissants (they're packed with so much chocolate and are so flaky). I'm a cannoli connoisseur, so I do have to say that I'm not a fan of their cannoli; the cream is a little thick and not as silky as I like a typical filling to be. But the bakery offers so many other tasty treats that I can't knock them on their cannoli alone. They're well staffed and very attentive to their customers. They're situated off the road with a huge gravel parking lot, so you don't have to worry about trying to find a space -- pick up is easy.",5,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown
"If you're a donuts fan, this is a must-stop shop during your trip to Vegas! You'll be surprised how big half of their donuts are! Yes, you'll also want to order one just to see if it's possible to finish one. Plus, they have very appealing regular sized donuts, so you may as well order one of those as well! I am also curious if the fish tank has real donuts at the bottom or fake ones - that was the hot debate in our group. I still say no way those were real!

"Having heard so much about it, and being a complete sugar-head, I REALLY wanted to like this place. It's open 24 hours and the caramel salted brownie is quite good. But, after 3 visits, I have tried several pastries and cakes and they are just ok at best and at worst kind of tasteless and spongy/heavy. The desserts are chilled and for some of them it makes them worse for the wear-- such as anything that is supposed to be flaky. Cute decor does not make up for mediocre sweets. I have yet to try their lunch/breakfast offerings, so maybe this is what keeps other reviewers so enthused.",2,Negative,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

They also give you an option to add toasted marshmallow fluff, which is absolutely perfect for anyone with a sweet tooth.

"On the Las Vegas Strip, The Linq Walkway filled with stores, restaurants, and fun things to do in Las Vegas. The High Roller Wheel is located towards the end of the Linq Walkway depending on which entrance you enter. It is right next to the parking lot. They have fun restaurants like Sushi Burrito, Gordon Ramsey Fish and Chips, Chayo Mexican Restaurant, and Sprinkles. Sprinkles is one of the dessert places on the Walkway. Sprinkles serves Ice Cream, Cookies, and Cupcakes. You can go inside the store to buy your craving, but if there is too long of a line or you don't want to talk to someone, located next to the store is Sprinkles' Pink Vending Machine. You can buy cookies and cupcakes from the vending machine, but there's not a large range of flavors than ordering inside the store. My friend wanted a Cupcake for her break from work, so I went to Sprinkles. Unfortunately, there was a long line inside the store, but luckily the line at the vending machine had only one other customer. From the section they offered, I ordered the Red Velvet Cupcake. It came in a cute package and the cupcakes had a cute design also. My friend really enjoyed the cupcake.

"If you would like to go to an average frozen custard place with the trademark response to any issue ""Sorry, can't do much! That's what the system is showing."", you're at the right place! Let me explain. I purchased a weekly special (parfait, $0.50 off). While purchasing, I informed the cashier that the amount she was telling wasn't the same amount the drive-through attendant told me. I got the trademark response. Without questioning her again, I bought it and went on my merry way. I wanted to double-check the price, so I called the next morning asking the regular price and weekly special price for comparison. Then I informed the incident to the person over the phone. And got a similar response ""Sorry can't do much now. I'll make sure to let others know."" You might think, it's only 50 cents. That's not the issue here. It's the principle! I have worked in the service industry before. Some places would above and beyond to keep their customers happy. I didn't see such an attitude from this place. Quite disappointed, tbh!

Walking the strip we wanted something sweet to snack on and something to wash it down with. We sampled the Better Nutter Cookie and Almond Chocolate Croissant (warmed up). If you love peanut butter you can't go wrong with the cookie. It was all sorts of peanut goodness. I'd recommend asking them to warm up your croissant - it melts in your mouth when you do! We had a Vanilla Latte and Iced London Fog (like an Earl Gray Tea Latte with Vanilla - but you have to ask for since it's not on the menu).

However, I have been here twice now and still feel that the desserts are alright. I recently got an oreo lobster tail and a piece of red relvet cake.

I considered buying the big pack after that, but I was going to the pool party at Marquee so it was not good timing. The next day, I came back and tried the cereal milk soft serve with corn flakes topping and I was hesitant to buy it since it was $6 for a super small cup but I'm so glad I did cause it was REALLY good.

My personal favorites? The famed salted caramel brownie, chocolate and plain croissants, any of the fruit tarts, and the macarons.

Their lot was not big enough for my truck and trailer. Plus that evening when I went, it was packed. I got the peanut butter chocolate ice cream sundae with whip cream. Man it was good and rich. I loved every last scoop of it. The pricing here is fantastic. Its not over priced at all. I almost thought the price was wrong for a second but it wasn't.

I also watched every episode of Cupcakes Wars which the creator of Sprinkles cupcakes judges (now I think I will rethink her opinions). I got the cinnamon ""cupcake""...I use the term cupcake loosely since mine tasted more like a dense muffin. Even if I poured milk directly on it I doubt it would be moist. My friend ordered the vanilla cupcake with milk chocolate frosting, also nothing to write home about. Overall I was thoroughly disappointed since I LOVE sweets. There are plenty of other local cupcake shops that I would choose over this chain.

"Love this bakery! Amelie has 3 locations in Charlotte but this is the only one that's open 24/7. Here's several highlights about this bakery: The salted caramel brownies are delicious! This is one of their best sellers... and I'd say that it lives up to the hype. I had the rose eclair on my last visit and while it was good, it didn't beat the brownies. I've been to this location multiple times and there's always a line to place an order. My last visit was on a Saturday around 8:30PM. There were probably about 15 people ahead of me. So if you're looking for a grab and go experience, this is not the place. The ambiance is very whimsical and cute. I love it! They have plenty of seating. Lots of people seem to come here to work. I've never done it so can't testify to the quality of their wifi or number of power outlets... however judging by the crowd, I can safely assume they do pretty good job on both.",5,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown

Delicious cupcakes. Excited they finally opened one here in Vegas. This location as already mentioned in other reviews is located at the Linq. We stopped by on a Friday night.

Should I get the triple scoop? No wait, I can't afford it. Damn."" Here's how to remedy falling into the unsatisfied trap: Completely overdo it. By upgrading to an ice cream sandwich, or an entrÃ©e-sized sundae with three flavors of ice cream, toffee, cookie pieces, brownie bites, torched marshmallows, hot fudge sauce, and the kitchen sink, you'll not only leave satisfied (and slightly ill, in a good way) but you'll get to appreciate why the place constantly basks in its own glory. All of the toppings and ice creams are house made, gourmet and covered in glittering, artisan snob dust. When was the last time you had an artisan, snob-dusted blow torched marshmallow? The verdict?

AmÃ©lie's has always been a staple delivering fresh handmade pastries, my favorites being the chocolate hazelnut tart and the salted caramel brownie. The workers are always helpful and don't mind telling you what things are. And after seeing the lines wrapped around the building, they still greet you with a smile.

"I'm probably the only person in Charlotte that hasn't visited Amelie's and shame on me. I stopped in for a desert and coffee on a Saturday afternoon. The pastry selection here was awesome. There is a one problem though, How do you choose? I had at least 3 items that I didn't think I could leave without. The coffee was also excellent. The service was friendly and fast. The decor is very eclectic and cool. Lots of different places to sit, with different tables and chairs, inside, outside, etc. A great place to stop in and just hang out for a bit, relax and grab a bite. I can't wait to come back and try a sandwich.",5,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown

Prices seemed fair. 2 cannoli and two iced mochas were under around $10. The wait was very long despite how many employees were there it seemed only a few were actually getting anything done. One woman helped our group of 4 and when I tried getting a young mans attention to add to our order he told me that I would need to talk to the woman helping us. The cannoli was amazing though and so was the iced mocha. Everything in the place looked fantastic.

"We taste tested 6 donuts. The grilled cheese and French toast were warm and delicious. None of the other donuts we taste tested were edible. By far Not the best donuts in the world........ Creme brÃ»lÃ©e was greasy, topping too hard and too thick, and cream was almost nonexistent. JJust about broke a tooth. Bought two because of the hype. Waste of money. If you're charging premium $$$$$ at the very least don't go cheap on the cream........ Bacon apple fritter was hyped. Horribly bland, almost no cinnamon and no apples. Horribly hard. Nothing was fresh. Everything was hard. Chocolate deluxe was all yeast with just chocolate on top. Nothing special. Wasn't fresh. Everything tasted like yesterday's donuts. And btw, we came early hoping to get them fresh for fair taste test. Last but not least, poor selection. More donut selection and much fresher at DD. Better value too. If you can't produce consistently high quality then don't charge high prices...... And don't hard stuff my dog wouldn't eat.

"This is the place I always suggest to visitors! I always want to take them to Amelie's because of the different vibe, unique decor, and delicious food. It just seems to be a Charlotte staple. I have tried several of the different pastries and desserts but I always end up landing back on the French Macaroons - my favorite: the pistachio (although I liked it better before they started adding the pistachio pieces on the outside, I think the extra baking of the pistachios changes their flavor). Anyway, I thought this was a great place to come and do homework when I was in graduate school, as it allowed for me to chill with my headphones or have group study sessions. The tricky part is timing. I have gone in with no line, and I have gone in other times and the line is wrapped into the other rooms of the building.

Yes I will give Amelie's five stars for their fresh delivery of their pastries. Salted caramel brownie is number one. However the sandwiches are pricey for 1 to 2 ounces of meat.

"I watched Christina Tosi as a master chef judge and was curious to try her desserts. Although the hype for this place is good, the prices are outrageous, however the quality is better than other dessert places I been to. And for the size of the dessert, it's a no go for the price. I got the bite sized cookie dough flavored confetti and it was really good, it was one of their truffles. The others were the cookies and they tasted kind of like any other cookie but with a different flavor than your typical cookie. The three cookies ran for $11 and the flavors were confetti, marshmallow and blueberry. The cookie truffle was 7$ and you get three small balls. It was definitely an experience that will be remembered. Was it worth the price tag? Hell No! But was it worth the experience. Yes! I would say give it a one time try and call it quits. I wouldn't go back, but the dessert is very good. Service was nonchalant. The employee that served me was kind of boring and annoyed about the pandemic, but pretty much everyone is. They wore gloves as well as having a clear shield in front so you don't come in contact with the employee.

"This place is THE BEST. I am addicted to matcha.. there is something about the grittiness bitter x sugar that I am obsessed with. Charlotte needs more asian fusion places if it really wants to be a diverse city so Matcha Cafe Maiko is a step in the right direction. Extra points for being in the suburbs so parking isn't hard. The matcha soft serve is premium grade- you can tell by the intensity of the color and how prominent the flavor is. Not a vanilla soft serve green tea ice cream you can get at a buffet but it ranks as high as Cha Cha Matcha in NYC. It packs a punch though so if you eat it on a weekend night expect to stay up for the next 6 hours. Also get the black sesame or hojicha ice cream, I actually feel like I'm in Japan. When I'm committed I will get the soft serve cone because they really top it high for you, but when I'm on the go I like getting the matcha float (they put matcha ice cream on top of matcha sugar water- it's good, I promise. They have a latte float version too but I can't handle so much dairy at once.) I wouldn't go there for the special though just because the way it's compiled makes it hard for you to mix the ice cream and the crunchy toppings. Anyway, was thinking of you Matcha Cafe Maiko so just thought I'd drop in and leave a review. Keep being amazing and come to the Triangle area thank you.

"Although nothing bizarre, the conservative type flavors are still solid choices. My favorites were Italian Cherry and Cookies and Mint. Everything was good, but those two really stood out. The creaminess of the ice cream is key to the ice cream's success. The flavorings are also quite potent, which I like. Nothing breaks my heart more than mildly flavored ice cream. I wanted to try their shakes or sundaes, but I also needed to save room for elsewhere at the time. I did pick a pretzel cone for my scoop. The pretzel isn't bad, but it wasn't what I was expecting. Its not as crumbly as a traditional waffle cone. Its not necessarily as sweet either, but it does add an undeniably delicious saltiness to each bite.",4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

I got my usual, a scoop of grape and a scoop of vanilla w oreo. YUMMY! Had some of Eds butter pecan....OMG so delish. The flavors are the same as Ohio (thank goodness). My reason for 4 stars is because the scoops seemed a lil skimpy compared to Youngstown which was a lil disappointing but my waistline thanks me :) Vegas....go treat yourself.

"After eating lunch at the Arrogant Butcher and a bit of walking around downtown Phoenix, me and my girlfriend headed back to her place in Scottsdale; but made a quick stop at Sweet Republic to satisfy our craving for something sweet. Upon walking in I had no idea just how famous this place was, until I saw a wall covered in press articles of recognition & until I saw the ""As Seen on the Food Network"" stamped on their menu for one of their ice cream dishes, the ""Toffee Banofi"" a double scoop of Madagascar Vanilla, fresh bananas, almond toffee brittle & salted butter caramel sauce. The interior is modern; slightly reminding me of Pinkberry and its modern decor. There is the counter that contains the ice cream, sorbets, and pastries. There are tables and chairs both inside and outside. There is a help-yourself water dispenser which came in handy after I got thirsty from eating 2 scoops of ice cream. There is also a stack of board games, near the water dispenser, to choose from and play with as you enjoy your ice cream at the tables. I admit that I'm boring when it comes to my preference for ice cream flavors. I tend to choose either vanilla or chocolate (or rocky road if I'm feeling adventurous). So surprise, surprise I ordered a scoop of their Madagascar Vanilla + a scoop of their Belgian Chocolate. You can definitely taste the quality and care that went into making these flavors. I personally preferred the Belgian Chocolate over the Madagascar Vanilla since the flavor was a bit more developed. I was able to sample the Horchata and the Espresso which were good but probably a bit too much for me had I ordered a scoop. Had I not been so full from lunch I would've liked to try the ""Campfire S'more"" a double scoop of Belgian Chocolate, roasted marshmallow & hot fudge in a waffle bowl but I suppose this is just one of many reasons to re-visit Arizona again!",4,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown

This location is new, but we used to drive all the way from Las Vegas to their location in Irvine, CA to spend $50 worth of stuff to bring home and snack on for a week. It was costly, but that's why I'm so happy to have a bakery so close by now. The layout of their operation is great too. No more waiting in line while servers rush to bring all of your items together. Grab a tray, grab some tongs, and pick up all the things you want, then bring the tray to the cashier for checkout. They will individually package each item for you if you're taking them to go. And every time I get to the checkout with a tray absolutely piled high with goodies, I'm always pleasantly surprised at how little it actually cost me.

I think they do a very good job with lunch items and their prices are reasonable. Coffee is decent and the baked goods are worth the calories and the price point is fair. I have other places in the area that I like more for baked goods, deli food, and coffee. However, no one has a combination of quality in all three off those categories, plus price, and pretty fast friendly service. And the clincher for Presti's is atmosphere.

After seeing the good reviews on yelp I decided to give it a try. $17.50 or so for a box of about 6? A bit pricey, but what isn't in Vegas? Out of all the flavors, I liked only the espresso one. It had a good amount of coffee taste to it, but not overwhelming. The filling used for these macarons are not overly sweet which tends to be the case with most places. But basically, all the other flavors with the exception of chocolate and espresso basically tasted to same to me. And maybe it was a bad batch, but out of the 6, I think half of them were hollow in the middle. Which is not how a properly made macaron should be. The girl that helped us was a bit slow?

When you buy one scoop of ice cream are the prices different for every scoop?

I was the only one in the shop by the time I arrived, being close to quitting time but the woman behind the counter was extremely helpful. The first thing I wanted to sample was the Cheese Duo flavor. It consisted of Roquefort cheese and Medjool dates. It was intense, rich and very unexpected. It was delicious but I wanted something ""cooler"". Then, as I walked over to the sorbet area, the flavor, Mango Lassi, caught my eye right away. I knew at that moment, the Mango Lassi was my treat for the night. I was so sure of myself, that I didn't even sample it. Once I put the spoon in my mouth, my craving was fulfilled, and I was happy.

I loved the creamy natural tasting peanut butter ice cream, but the cone was a bit of a let down. It was a tad too salty and not light and airy like a regular pretzel.

This makes Milk a huge draw for a lot of people (including me), so don't be surprised if you visit and it's packed. We lucked out and it was completely empty when we stopped by early on a weekday, so we had no wait and we were able to order quickly. On this visit I opted for a Cereal Milk Latte, as I had just had breakfast and didn't have room for much more, but Milk offers so much more! They're slinging some standard desserts including truffles, pie, milkshakes, cake, and cookies; BUT, they offer them up in flavors you're not going to find anywhere else. First, their Birthday Cake flavor is unlike any other. Why? I don't know. It just is. And it's delicious! Try the Birthday Cake or the B'Day Truffles. They also have Cereal Milk (like my latte) and the Milk Bar Pie (a.k.a. Crack Pie) is bomb! If you're in the mood to opt for a cookie, try The Compost Cookie, it's got a hodgepodge of mix-ins, and it's delicious! And this Vegas location has tons of alcoholic drink options as well. Milk is a bit pricey, and depending on when you visit there may be a line, but I honestly think the desserts are worth it. It's not fancy, so please don't expect that, but if you're looking for a delicious cake, cookie, or pie, then Milk Bar is your spot.",4,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"Where has this ice cream been all my life?! Absolutely- delicious! The texture and flavor is unlike any other. I had a chocolate scoop paired up with a chocolate dipped waffle cone... because I obviously love chocolate, and it was chocolate heaven for my taste buds. Now let's talk about customer service. The BEST customer service received on my entire trip. We were greeted promptly at the door. We got free chocolate samples. Someone was ready at the register. I enjoyed the atmosphere so much, I decided to sit down and have my ice cream inside the establishment. Which was well kept and welcoming. #TeamGhirardelli",5,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown
"This might be my favorite Ice Cream shop in Arizona. And it get so much better as it's local! SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL COMPANIES! THIS IS MERICUH!! Actually to be honest I'll support any shop that has ice cream in it. Some information I guess since this is a review. -My favorite Ice Cream flavors by far are the Salted Butter Caramel and the Maple Pecan. But I've never had a bad flavor yet from them. And oh you better believe that I have tried them all. Possibly sampled every flavor every time I've went. -I love that it is open til 10pm. Seriously, who hasn't had the late night cravings for ice cream?? and Wow Thanks to Yelp I now know that it is open til 11pm on Fridays and Saturdays. This place gets better and better! If they would now only be open 24 hours then my dream of having premium ice cream at 3am can now be fulfilled. -They have Almond brittle -They have Bacon Brittle -Let me repeat that. They have BACON Brittle. This is by far the best bacon brittle that I've had. Makes me want to buy a package and sprinkle it all over everything. IF bacon makes everything taste better, how about bacon brittle?!? -Toffee Banofi. Just get it. I rate this place 5 stars. Woohoo!

"Short Review: Donut Bar originated in San Diego and places an emphasis on fresh, tasty, picture worthy, and creative donuts. If a caked donut full of sugar is your thing, then give Donut Bar a try. Donut Bar is considered one the best and their customer service is excellent. Just be early because these donuts sell out fast. Longer Review: I remember the excitement when Donut Bar opened in Las Vegas. I'm not going to lie. I wasn't that excited when I heard the news. I didn't bookmark this place and had the opinion that Donut Bar was just hype. I'm originally from the 619 and remember when the first Donut Bar opened their doors in Daygo. I was one of those people that waited in line. The owner of that location was pretty cool and would walk by the line with full sized donut samples to patrons waiting to get in. Originally, I wasn't a fan. I had a few failed visits because their donuts were either out or I got something that was too sweet. I always picked a donut that just didn't ""wow"" me. I am also not into a cake donut with a bunch of sugar on it. I'm really boring when it comes to my donuts. I prefer a chocolate glazed raised donut, maple bar, cruller, or an apple fritter. That's all I really need or want when I'm in a donut shop. But when the girlfriend loves donuts, then you support her by eating donuts. I have been here a couple of times since grand opening week. I've tried the Samoa, The French Toast, Cake Batter, Caramel Latte, the Big Poppa Tart, CrÃ¨me Brulee, Matcha Cake, PB&J, and of course, the Homer. Their originality, freshness, and consistency stands out. I haven't had anything here that was too oily and greasy. Again, these donuts really do not appeal to me and in my opinion, just too sweet. But then I had their Caramel Latte. This donut is perfectly glazed with their latte flavor. Then a little whipped cream and caramel is added. Because this donut is large, the glaze and toppings do not give it that overly sweet taste. The texture is also perfect and not dry at all. This donut with a cup of their hot coffee equals perfection. I will cheat on my chocolate raised donut any day for their Caramel Latte. This donut alone made me a fan. 2017 Yelp Review #77",4,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"The macarons were pretty standard, and on the pricey side unless you get a 5 pack. Would give them 4 stars, but the first time we tried to go there, it was an absolute nightmare. We asked two Venetian employees where it was; one gave directions to the ""closest one"" and said there were three locations, the other said there was only one location and directed us to the one under the escalators by the Grand Lux. We arrived at that location 7 minutes before 9 (closing time) and the place was abandoned. We made it to the one facing the Strip about 3 minutes later just by chance and it was also closed. That location also opened late the next morning when we went back and I would have foregone the entire thing had I not wanted macarons so badly before my flight home. On the plus side, there was no line at all and I really liked the packaging of the 5-pack for the airplane.",3,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

At times, we get overwhelmed with the crowd there, but we never fail to see cute babies and indulge in some fantastic desserts! The stromboli is amazing as well!

"Now as a vegan, I wanted to write a new review to reflect my thoughts on Novel Ice Cream. I visited with some friends on Friday night. The space is really small and there were two people behind the counter serving samples, scooping scoops, and checking us out. With about 6-7 people ahead of us, It took about 15 minutes before we got to the ordering counter. We taste tested the two vegan flavors that they offered in the current moment - lychee and some sort of berry sorbet. The berry sorbet was VERY sweet, but the lychee was perfect! I shared a double scoop with my partner and added a single vegan topping. While the berry was overly sweet, the lychee was able to tone it down a bit. I believe they also offer a vegan sprinkle cookie and certain cereals as toppings! Maybe they'll make vegan doughnuts or offer more vegan flavors one day?? Know that there was plenty of street parking when we arrived. There was a scatter of people before our arrival. When we got our ice cream, there was a long line of about 15 people down the ramp! Timing is everything I suppose. Love the vegan offerings and will be back/recommend because of this!",5,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,Positive,unknown,unknown

"Donuts & coffee, the forever couple. This place gets it right in a cute downtown location. I went early afternoon on a weekday and there was still a good selection of a variety of flavors. These are really aesthetic ""crowd-pleasing"" donuts, I tried three. They're lighter (yeast-raised) than fancy donuts elsewhere, not so much the ""i had two and I don't need to eat again today"" I've run into elsewhere. The prices are also surprisingly competitive. Discounts for a dozen, and there were some basic bar-shaped donuts for just a dollar when I was there. This place won't break the bank.

Best cookies to order in my opinion are the compost and cornflake-chocolate-chip-marshmallow cookie. I honest feel like the cornflake is the best. If you have a craving for corn, grab the cornbread cookie. First time I had it, it hit the spot... Second time around it kind of tasted different. Hoping that that was just the heat and alcohol causing the difference. When ordering the soft serve, do yourself a got damn favor and get the crack pie with cornflakes... That shit is FIRE!

We took our, who was a first timer, into the shop as well and told her about all the yummy options!! I didn't want too much so I ordered 2 scoops of Cookie Monster with hot fudge. The server seemed to not understand my order but finally got it straight. It wasn't bad. For $8.99, it should be amazing, right? My friend ordered a chocolate milkshake. Again, a different server seemed to be lost on what to do. In the times of today where lots of places are short on help, I wasn't surprised. She also asked for whipped cream, which is an added charge. This shake took 5 minutes to make. Not sure why. And her whipped cream wasn't on it. She said something about it didn't taste right. We couldn't figure out what. My husband ordered the cookies with ice cream. It's our most favorite thing. He was extremely disappointed. The cookies were really hard and didn't taste fresh. The store was busy but the employees seemed off. There wasn't a lot of communication and the whole visit was just not what we had hoped. It felt messy in there.

"As I walked up to the window, the concrete floors were swept, and the stainless-steel countertops were, pun intended, stainless. The red, white, and blue color scheme occupied my line of sight. The pictures posted of the ice cream dropped my jaw to the ground and led a river to flow out of my mouth. The gorgeous atmosphere and savoring pictures give a warm welcome to anyone who approaches. However, the long line of desert hungry people awaiting to have their orders taken haunted me. I stood distraught at the idea of this long line starting at the window and ending at the handicap parking space. The waiting time just get up to the window was around eight minutes; this was a minor inconvenience that can later be redeemed if the ice cream is delicious. On my first visit, I was overwhelmed by the dozens of flavors mounted on the sign. I was taunted by each flavor. It felt like each flavor of ice cream was calling out to me to get a scoop. The multiple freezers you can see inside the store only make you wonder what flavor is hidden inside. Any concoction you can make up, they will probably have it. They had a variety of ice cream flavors such as Chocolate Malt with Caramel, Banana Nut Cake, Coffee Chocolate Chip, and Pistachio. Not only does Handel's serve ice cream, they serve sherbets, ices, fat-free ice cream with no sugar added, and low-fat yogurt (if you want a somewhat healthier option). The manifold of desert options given at Handel's flood your head as soon as you come face to face with the menu. The various ways you can get the ice cream served is also endless. You can get your ice cream served in four different types of cones, in a normal bowl, or even in a quart and pint. Your ice cream can also be made into different variations; they can be served as a banana split, a sundae, a hurricane, and as a popsicle. This variety, for both flavors of ice cream and ways the ice cream is served, really impressed me. Some ice cream shops I have visited just have a couple of tubs of ice cream and they have the option of it being served in a bowl or cone. The fact that Handel's has been able to branch out of being a traditional ice cream shop made me set it apart from any other ice cream shops. Once I got up to the window to order, I found the service to be mediocre, well at least from the person serving me. He greeted me and took my order, but what became prominent is that he did not want to be there, which is understandable. He did not receive me with a smile on his face and he forgot one thing I ordered. The waiting time to get the ice cream in your hands can also take a while as they have to walk away and scoop into a tub of frozen cream and sugar. I then got the ice cream in my hands. I got a tower of the Chocoholic Chunk and I tried Banana's Foster, Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, and Chocolate Peanut Butter Brownie from those I went with. My ice cream of choice was a chocolate party because the ice cream was very rich in chocolate and had chunks of chocolate all throughout. You had a chunk in each bite, and the best part was that the chocolate was not hard and chalky like the M&M's get in a Mcflurry. As I just got a lick of the three other flavors I can only have a minimal opinion. The Banana's Foster was a blast of banana with a hit of sweet caramel. The Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough had the same big lumps of chocolate and smooth indulgent balls of cookie dough all mixed in a rich vanilla ice cream. The Chocolate Peanut Butter Brownie had squares of chocolate rich brownies and scoops of actual peanut butter spread throughout the chocolate ice cream. The intensity of these flavors freezing our tongues made the wait worth it. If the ice cream is this indulging the prices must be outrageous as well. Each type of cone and bowl come with a price less than five dollars. Each of these cones come with a pile of three of more scoops making the price well worth it. The pints and a plate with four scoops of ice cream are also around five dollars. What I believe is a great deal at Handel's is the Two Buck Tuesday promotion they have every Tuesday. Any cone or bowl of ice cream will come down to two dollars each rather than four dollars. If you decide to go on a Tuesday, you better be ready for the long lines! The price point is perfect for a flavor packed scoop of ice cream.",5,Positive,Positive,Negative,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Negative,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown
"I completely forgot how awesome Batch was until a recent trip back to Madison. I was pleased that they finally relocated to the bigger storefront, which to me meant that they'd likely have more goodies to offer. I was not disappointed. I've had numerous great items in the past from Batch, from their baguettes to the popular monkey bread. One of my favorite pastries since I was a kid was the ""morning bun."" I was like a little kid in a candy store when I saw that Batch had one of their own on my recent stop. As what Corey D woul say, ""son of a batch!"" This big buttery ball of goodness topped with gooey caramel may have been one of the best morning buns I had ever eaten........believe me, I've eaten many. This one may actually rival Simma's in Milwaukee. This alone would warrant 10 stars, but damn Yelp only allows five!

Here's the down-low it took this owner 2 years, to find the perfect ice cream maker, and a year to perfect his doughnuts! So bottom line; the PERFECT doughnut is stuffed with perfect ice cream! Here's the scoop, there's 12 flavors of ice cream, handfuls of toppings, and cereal, if you choose, to top off your ice cream. I tried all flavors before deciding on what I think is the best combination in the world! Strawberry balsamic and a scoop of honey lavender! I kid you not, it's the best! My son got Cookie Monster stuffed in a warm doughnut, hubby got bourbon toffee with cinnamon crunch cereal stuffed in a warm delicious doughnut! This may sound over sweet, and stomach churning with sugar overload, on the contrary....it's not too sweet! It's perfected to be balanced, leaving you wanting more! It's magic, I don't understand it?

I can't say how totally disappointed I was in going to the Vegas location of Carlo's Bakery!! I don't gamble and I'm not into Blue a man Group so for me Vegas is visiting family and getting good grub. I love lobster tails and I'm not talking the fishy kind I'm talking the amazing east coast confection that is slightly crisp on the outside but soft and gooey and filled with a delicious custard.. unfortunately that's not what I got at Carlo's.!! I wished I'd have tasted one before I bought 7 of them to take home to friends.. well I couldn't wait so on the car ride home to AZ I dug in and wished I'd had a trash can to spit it back out.. it was awful hard beyond belief with hardly any filling and tasted so badly of old grease that I could only take that one bite.. I had my husband try another one hoping it was just the one and he couldn't take but one bite either.. the whole batch tasted like four day old leftovers yet we had only gotten them an hour before and we specifically got to the bakery early to get the freshest ones. Well I think we got the oldest ones they had.. not going to go back here maybe when we visit friends in Jersey we will try the original shop.. sorry Buddy this place was terrible!!,1,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

I'm also a huge fan of Matcha and I absolutely love their Matcha ice cream since it's not overly sweet. My latest addiction is their Ube Latte with Oak Milk. They have since added some pastry items to their menu and my favorite is the Matcha Cream Puffs. The store is really bright and clean. The staff is always friendly and so patient since I have a hard time making a decision sometimes. I love how you can order online as well.

AmÃ©lie's is open 24/7, no matter what time they will always be a macaron (or some delicious pastry) and drink waiting for you there. The service is super fast as it is counter service with wonderful drinks like Rose tea or rose syrup in random drinks. They carry wonderful brands like Harney & Sons (which to me is great). They also have a mean chai and espresso. The service is super fast especially if you're like me and you're counting down the hours for when you'll come home. The art decor ;(sadly I have no pics), is very hobo chicish, old looking art such as Mona Lisa with hipster sunglasses, random shoes all over the place that remind me of the movie Marie Antoinette.

The milk soft serve with crunchy cereal add-on ended up costing me $7 something. I was like ??? at the moment because I couldn't believe I paid that much just for ice cream. The price might work for NYC but definitely not sustainable here. There's no line when I visited. The soft serve was good but I think the cereal was a bit too salty.

I really wanted to try one of their lattes but can't have caffeinated coffee, unfortunately for me they don't have decaf espresso so I didn't get to try one. My husband really enjoyed his though. I tried a bite of nearly everything and it was all so sweet. I eat baked goods a lot so I expect them to be sweet, but these were so sugary I just couldn't stomach much of it. They were all good but far from the best I've had. The tables were littered with crumbs and hadn't been cleaned, which is a little off putting. The service behind the counter was helpful and prompt.

"The Crepe deserves 10 stars - it's as good as street crepes in Paris. It's the only one in North America which is. The service deserves minus 10. They're about as joyous as Thom Yorke Radiohead trapped in a Medieval Torture Device during a family bereavement. ""Crepes"" by Radiohead When you were here before The servers wouldn't look you in the eye They don't act like angels And they make you cry They ruffle your feathers They live in a gloomy world They think they're so special They're so f***ing special But they have crepes! And you're a weirdo! That's why you keep coming here! Even though they treat you wrong here I sang that out loud last time I was here. You should have seen the dirty Luxe I got. I'm giving them a 5 star rating despite them having the worst service - perhaps that I've ever experienced. And if you have a problem with that, I don't give a crepe. It's one of the worst customer service experiences of my life, but it's also the best crepe in North America, so I'm giving it a 5 when they deserve a huge 0 (a zero, not an O, no way) for the enormity of their attitude problems. What to get: Crepe with sugar and lemon. That's it. Nothing fancy. Trust me bae. What not to get: Angry when they treat you like a pile of horse sh**. These kind of Luxe might not be for Lorde, but they're absolutely for me. I'd say (and there is some decent competition in Philly and Indy among other places) that this is the best Crepe I've had in the USA. It's the most similar to France. Shame about the sh** service though. What a contradiction. We're talking about probably the best crepe and found in North America. I would know. I love this sh**. I go to France for this sh**. I know which alley in Paris the very best and most moist (moistmost) can be found in. I am the sh** when it comes to knowing sh** about which crepes are the sh**. Most Americans (I'm British, and we like talking sh**) grow up on sh** bland sh** crepes so they wouldn't know the sh**ting difference, would they? Like sh** they would. So these are the most authentic and traditional and true to the style of France. I think whoever started making these must have visited France a good number of times because this is almost the way they taste on the streets of Paris. Get it with nothing but sugar and lemon. That's the French way. In addition to being hairy and thin and making out a lot. With more than church tongue. On the other hand, we're talking about some of the worst service imaginable. I mean I've had so many bad service experiences here I don't even want to go into most of them. I can think of 5. I'll just tell you about one. Most recently I stood in line for about 10 minutes - about 5 minutes before closing - and they refused to give me a crepe. They weren't remotely nice or apologetic. I explained I was only in town from Buffalo once every 6 months, and that I'd just stood in line for 10 min, and there were still 5 mins to go. And they were passively aggressively complaining about people being in their line close to closing time and saying things like (loudly) such as ""I hope those people don't think they're actually going to get served"" and ""don't you just love when people feel entitled to get served after we're closed."" It wasn't just one or two comments. They were loudly giving sarcastic crap to their customers (particularly me) for a good few minutes, all the way not actually telling me directly, sorry, we're closed, come back tomorrow. They waited until the clock had ticked to closing time for that. Hmm, how convenient. I've written what, 5,000 reviews? Near enough. I don't think I've ever been served by people quite this rude. And consistently so. It's definitely in my 5 most offensive and ugly customer service experiences. So They get -5 stars for massive customer service problems and horrendous attitudes and treating their customers like sh**. On the other hand I'm basing my actual rating only on the taste of the wonderful Crepes so it gets 5 Stars although I do so with a heavy heart because they are absolutely awful to their customers particularly me but it's happened so often that it probably happens to others too and I bet they'd have way better ratings if they were even remotely nice or fair to the people paying for their products run on sentences ftw amirite.

"Girlfriends would boast about Bouchon so this was my first shot of trying one out. Well, at least the bakery part. There's apparently 3 locations within the Venetian Casino, I managed to find two out of three. This one I found was near one of the hotel entrances. The line builds up quickly, so if you've heard of Bouchon or can smell the pastry, get in line! And no cutting!!!! Tried their regular and chcolat croissant---they nailed it perfectly just like the ones in Paris. Vanilla and chocolate eclair: so damn yummy. Each bite explodes of flavor, I'll leave that to you to think about. What they dropped the ball on the bread pudding. Way too much raisins jammed into the overly dry pastry that you end up building a pile of raisins as you rip through pieces of the bread pudding. Mind you, we got out pastries at 9am. Another note that if you order any type of drinks here on top of the pastry, you pay for everything, get the pastries up front...but the procedure on how you get your drink is idiotic. That definitely needs to be improved because not noting what they just made or even a name to a particular drinks= many pissed off faces standing by a counter that only lets one person get to it to get a drink. One. at. a. time. Oh dear...",3,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown
"This place is heaven! The perfect spot for a cup of tea and a slice of delicious cake. Perfect for a craving as they serve by the slice and they are always making fresh, new cakes. They also make excellent full sized cakes per whatever you want, truly amazing.",5,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

On my very first visit to this Carlos Bakery in Las Vegas inside The Grand Canal Shopes at The Palazzo/The Venetian. The wait to get in was really no wait at all because I came around the slow part of the day. I got a cannoli which I had always wanted to try. It was extremely delicious and fairly priced too. I also purchased A souvenir metal coffee mug. I love the food their and next time im in the area im going to come back for more for sure. If you want awesome desserts that's delicious in your stomach and good on the wallet come to Carlos Bakery the worlds greatest bakery.,5,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown
