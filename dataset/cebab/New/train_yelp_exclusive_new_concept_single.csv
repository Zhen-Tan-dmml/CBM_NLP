"Despite how nice he was, the teenage counter boy totally judged me when I ordered a double scoop right after devouring a cup of triple scoop. Not the best ice cream I've had and a little pricier than most places, but definitely good enough for my afternoon recess time when I just want to indulge in being fat and alone. Get: salted butter caramel, peanut butter chip, lavender, white rose, medjool date Add: toasted marshmallow, bacon brittle bits Try: everything (like I shamelessly did)",4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
SO GOOD EVERYTHING ABOUT IT. Love the down town feel. You can tell the ice cream is homemade and the doughnuts too.

"Make sure you take a number, there are no lines, just wait to be called out. The service is fairly quick. It was hoppin on a Saturday mid afternoon. The bakery items are descent, not fabulous. I've been here a few times and if you have a sweet tooth, it isn't bad, just not really memorable or in my opinion, worth the calories. Today I needed a quick counter service meal and ordered the vege Stromboli. I would not suggest coming here to eat. Looking at the food, nothing looked special or jumped out at me. I kinda wish I hadn't bothered. The menu board said the Stromboli had ""spinach mushrooms olives and roasted red peppers."" The olives were all together absent and the other three ingredients came from a freezer bag, can or jar. There was also a scant amount of ricotta cheese in there. It was blah.",2,Negative,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

This review is for 4.5 stars. Expensive all around but tasty and novel. Come here and just go fill out. Try the milkshakes the pie and the soft serve. Each will run you about $6-15 but well worth it. This will be the best version of whatever you order. We tried the crack pie and the cereal milk soft serve for $6.50 each and an additional $1.50 for the cereal crunch topping (necessary). The soft serves wee large enough for a nice after dinner dessert and they even give you samples of you ask before choosing the soft serve. Line can get log during peak but pretty fast service once ordered. The cereal milk is just so unique of an idea and deserves its infamy. Tastes as it sounds and if you let it melt drinks as it sounds. The crack pie is super buttery and just a very smooth and rich vanilla. Terrific flavors.,4,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"We got the bacon cinnamon roll, caramel latte donut and the creme brulee donut. The creme brulee donut was normal sized, the cinnamon roll was just a little bigger than average, but thr caramel latte donut was huge. Even splitting them, we could not finish it all.

That sample made me wish we had gotten one of those for sure.",5,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Venetian is dangerous. I hardly walked pass the slot machines without stopping at the Chinese Queen machine because of the lights. I was on my way to the Phantom Theater to pick up my tickets for the night, and I passed by Bouchon Bakery. I was suckered into their macarons. They sell them individually and in a pack. I couldn't resist and I couldn't decide on which to get. My love told me I could get whichever one I wanted, while he orders a turkey cranberry sandwich. So I ended up getting that pack. Yes, fat girls' problems, but it's worth it. They were of six different colors, There's a vanilla, chocolate, coffee, pistachio, raspberry, and caramel flavored. I posted a picture of it, colors do get to me. They're not too sweet, which I liked. My favorite ones were the pistachio and the coffee ones. I find the jam inside the raspberry one to be a little too overwhelming. The size is enough to split with someone else, especially if you want a bit of everything at once. Their sandwiches are pretty good too, especially for a quick lunch. The baguette bread was crunchy on the outside and quite soft in the insides. Too bad I devoured it too soon (I wanted to spend more time with my macarons). The bad part is that you have nowhere to sit and eat. It's like a grab and go cafe.",5,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Tried this and was a bit disappointed as everything was mass produced. The cookies were packaged in bags and were not fresh. The cereal milk soft serve was okay nothing too special. The one thing I did like was the crack pie! It's supposed to be served cold, but I recommend getting it down to room temperature and enjoying it that way. You can't really heat it up because it's a custard pie. Overall, service was good, but wouldn't really go back for their cookies. I would for their crack pie.",3,Negative,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
Great idea! Cool space. Tasty shakes. I loved the cereal decor. It's a great unique idea for a place in a cool area of Uptown/ The staff was a little disengaged on the Friday night we visited.

"One of my favorite bakeries in Charlotte! The owner is extremely passionate in her baking & continues to serve in her community. When her original store got severely damaged from the flood, the community stepped in to help her recover.

"Bangkok Peanut: a seasonal summer flavor of peanut, coconut, and just the slightest bit of heat. It is still sweet like an ice cream and had little flecks of coconut. I loved it. Coffee with Cream & Sugar: hands down the best coffee ice cream I've ever had. The taste makes you feel like you're holding a great cup of dark roast. The cream keeps it balanced from becoming overpowering. Wildberry Lavender: tasted more orange then lavender to me and would pair well with Milkiest Chocolate. Also, the color is gorgeous. The Jeni's Charlotte South End spot is small and lines during opening week can exceed 1 hour. They are open 11am-11pm every day, so be sure to plan your visit.

The sweets are also very good. The shortbread cookies are sweet and special. I also like the dark chocolate cake with espresso syrup. It's super moisture inside, and the texture is so soft. Almost feels like drinking chocolate down your throat. Amazing!

"I've always been a huge Jack Frost fan. Their donuts are delicious and beautiful. Unfortunately, my recent experience was not a good one. Last weekend I attempted to purchase donuts for two events. The first was a order of cannoli donuts for a birthday party and the second was a donut cake. I attempted to place these orders several times. My repeated phone calls went unanswered and when I'd stop in to place the order, the shop would be sold out and closed. When I finally went there and found them open, I was told that I could not place a cake order. The manager would have to call me. I did place the order for the cannoli donuts and paid for them in advance. Several hours later the manager called me and I placed the cake order, paying for it over the phone as required. When I arrived a few days later, they gave me the cake and informed me that I had never placed the order for the cannoli donuts. The woman who had told me this was the same one who had taken my order in person and who I had paid. She attempted to text the manager who was once again not in the shop. The manager did not answer. She then found the order and told me they weren't made. She gave me two dozen donuts, which were not the type I wanted, and told me the manager would call me. I've waited an entire week to write this review, hoping that Jack Frost would correct this issue, that I'd at least get a call from the manager and that they'd offer to make me the cannoli donuts. They have not contacted me and at this point, I doubt they will. While Jack Frost's donuts are beautiful and delicious, I don't see myself returning. Their customer service is terrible. I'm truly disappointed in them.",1,Positive,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"After hitting Grapes on Shea and Scottsdale for happy hour today- review coming shortly (maybe... hey, I've 12 other reviews that need to be written!), I headed to Sweet Republic for a sweet ending. I'd received a newsletter from SR that there were new flavors in honor of Valentine's Day, and I thought what a great reason to pay SR another visit! Of the two Valentine specials, Raspberry White Chocolate and White Roses, I could only sample the latter, as the former contained an allergen. I'm a sucker for floral-scented food and drink, and this SR delight was a winner! I could definitely taste roses, and the sweet cream wasn't too sweet. Loved it! I also sampled Desert Honey (a tart yogurt sweetened w/ local AZ wild desert honey), Almond Buttercrunch, Salted Butter Caramel, Cheese Course Duo, Espresso, and Mango Lassi. I took a pint of White Roses and Desert Honey ($7.50) and a scoop of Salted Butter Caramel to-go and a scoop of Almond Buttercrunch in a waffle cone (2 scoops $4.25 + $1 for waffle cone) to savor! I couldn't pass up a Chocolate Chip Walnut Oatmeal cookie ($3) as it looked so delicious on its cake display stand- one of the proprietors, Helen, offered to warm it up in the microwave. What a wonderful suggestion! I asked if she could tear off a section and warm it up... The warmed bite I took at the store was amazingly good! (I did notice that the rest of the soft-batch cookie, sampled in the car, was definitely saltier than I'd wish for in a cookie. Why didn't I detect this saltiness in the warmed-up section? Perhaps the sweetness of the almond buttercrunch made my tastebuds more sensitive to salt? Hmm...) I really enjoyed the almond buttercrunch and the cone, so much so that I wished I'd skipped on the salted butter caramel- heresy some fans of this flavor might think, but what can I say? I loved extra textural component, and the buttery toffee-sweet crunch, that the almonds provided. I may be back, maybe as soon as tomorrow!, to re-visit the espresso and the mango lassi (and grab a few more of those chocolate chip walnut cookies!). ;) p.s. Couldn't resist and just had to taste a couple scoopfuls of desert honey and white roses before placing the pint in the freezer... Oh. My. God! Run to SR before Valentine's Day is over and White Roses disappear from the rotation! (Just remember to bring your credit card- a visit could get expensive!)",4,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"I liked this place but I think it comes down to what you were raised on. I think Krispy Kreme is trash because I grew up on Shipleys. Shipleys has the best yeast donut to Me. This place the yeast is gigantic and a lil heavier but there glazes are really good hear. They are at a premium price but I will say the donuts are large. Lots of cool flavors to try, I wish the Pop tart one had actual pop tart filling but that's asking a lot. A lovely young lady in line with me suggested the French toast joint so consider it if you come. Nice way to stretch your legs in the morning if your staying on Fremont and wake your crew up with donuts.",4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"After following Carlo's bakery for many years and seeing that the lobster tail is one of the best pastries, we tried it and it was just ok, the cream inside was good but the outside was very dry and the pastry itself was not the best tasting.",3,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"Man oh man can you drop a pretty penny here. Donuts start at $3 and go up to $6! Watch out for those pricey ones though, they're monsters.. I believe between four friends, we ordered to our hearts content (which ended up being 8 donuts and about $35, including chocolate milk for all). They supposedly have homemade strawberry milk on tap but I have my doubts since they were sold out the last two times I tried to stop in. (Maybe the trick is to go early? But how do I know the strawberry milk is worth getting up at 7am???) In any case, the donuts were magic. I highly recommend the creme brÃ»lÃ©e donut since it was one of the more unique ones we had. Personally, not my favorite. The caramelization on top tasted more like honey to me than anything else but I still recommend giving it a go since I've never seen anything like it anywhere else. Also the big poppa tart donuts are INSANE. Way too much volume for my belly. It was tasty but hard to enjoy such a monstrosity. I ended up taking two-thirds of it home. We also tried the strawberry split though I wasn't all that impressed. It's a sugar donut with whipped cream and strawberries in it.. plain and simple. There are definitely better options here, in my opinion.. If I were to offer a few pieces of advice: stick to the classics (they do their simple donuts very VERY well) and GO EARLY TO GET THE STRAWBERRY MILK. I think it's one of those mystical menu items that may or may not exist in real life.. hmm...",4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Being a fan of David Chang & the Momofuku empire, its a pleasure to see Milk Bar stand out as another entity. David Chang recognized excellence and created a new branch of the business with Christina Torsi called Milk Bar. Milk Bar sells cookies, pies and crazy ice cream with cereal flavors. Man, I love cereal! To see a Milk Bar in Las Vegas, in the 110 degree weather no less, Milk Bar ice cream is an oasis in the desert. I walked up to the counter and ordered a cereal ice cream. I was asked if I would like the cereal cornflake crunch topping for an extra charge. Yes please :) The cereal crunch mix is amazing and different. To have this outpost in Las Vegas is a welcomed treat. I ordered a Cereal Milk Soft Serve with cornflake crumble topping. The ice cream itself is made with milk, cornflakes and brown sugar. It tastes just like the milk at the bottom of a bowl of cornflakes! I highly recommend Milk Bar Las Vegas, its one of my guilty pleasures :)",4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

We shared the compost cookie and it tasted ridiculous. It was by far the worst cookie I had ever tasted, but the marshmallow cookie was alright. It was not an enjoyable place, and seems like a place that only drunks enjoy.

I was planning the event from another state so I had to do everything via email. They were so easy to work with! They had great flavor suggestions. I also asked if they could put just a few fresh flowers on a few of the cakes to be pretty. When it was finally the day to pick them up, pick up was a breeze. I didn't open the box until we got home and CHILLS!!! I literally got chills for how gorgeous the cakes were! Each one was a perfect little masterpiece. I ordered 5 flavors, 3 for the shower and 2 for the bachelorette part to follow. They were too gorgeous, so all 5 went to the shower! All of the ladies oohed and ahhed over them. But that wasn't even the best part: they tasted AMAZING!! I couldn't be happier with Butterwood!! They really added a special touch to a special day! I just wished I still lived in Pittsburgh so I could visit there all of the time and try all of their amazing treats and interesting flavors! Also, side note, though I just stopped in to pick up the cakes, the shop is also amazing! Great decor and atmosphere! I'd die to be on a date with my man or my mum here! PERFECTION all around!!

So the quality of the product now vs when it first opened - has changed a lot. I ordered 7 lobster tails & they were shaped like very little effort was put into it.

I wanted to try the crack pie but it was already so pricey that I skipped it. The soft serve was delicious, I loved the crunchy flavor of the cereal, it was not too sweet but had a slight salty flavor to it. I really liked the texture it was dense and rich.

"I am SO glad I gave Sprinkles another chance. Not being wowed by their original Beverly Hills location avoided them for the last few years but kept wanting to try their ice cream. A new addition to the Vegas Strip, The Linq, which reminds me a bit of LA anyways, had a Sprinkles location both for cupcakes AND ice cream! Perfect timing in the middle of the afternoon (though Vegas is always hot and you can eat ice cream any time of day) A few customers in the cupcake side, no one at the ice cream counter. TONS of flavors, most rotate daily, we had about 20 to chose from. So many great sounding flavors, the usual pig in my would have wanted to sample them all. I went with a sample of the only sorbet, strawberry, and was SOLD! THAT good, SO refreshing, simply perfect. I came for the red velvet waffle cone but wound up ""needing"" a cupcake sundae. Chose a cupcake, they split and fill with ice cream. Went with the red velvet and was in love! So fresh, soft, moist, everything a cupcake should be. The cream cheese frosting had way too much sugar, not my fav, but I am now finally convinced that it is not just hype, Sprinkles really makes some great cupcakes and I will be back for more of that ice cream!",4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"Bruh this my favorite ice cream place. Hot take but I don't think the west coast (yes consider Vegas west coast) has good non-Asian ice cream, but this was a shining beacon of hope for us picky ice cream eaters. Salt & Straw is shaking. I recommend the milk flavor and birthday cake swirl (not sure if I got the verbiage right) with fudge topping and sprinkles. Milk Bar is located in the Cosmopolitan hotel, near the entrance to Marquee, so it's perfect for when you just finished getting yurnt at the dayclub and want something to hold you over until dinner, before you hit the nightclub. The only thing is that the portion is pretty big, so you'll probably want to split with someone. The ice cream was $8 and I had to throw half of it away since I couldn't finish it, and I'll regret this moment for the rest of my life.

"Sweet Republic's namesake is apt in its home country, as it represents an almost patriotically capitalistic approach to frozen dessert - it is quite possibly the most expensive ice cream I've ever eaten in a venue solely targeting it, with a double ($4.50) that barely exceeded other boutique creamery's singles. Fortunately, the quality and preparation are commensurate with the price, and unlike other hyper premium ice cream, it doesn't feel so loaded with fat that a toothpick is the ideal utensil (although a gelato spoon is still recommended to stretch out one's savoring, even with the larger sizes.) It is worth noting predominantly that their approach is not for everyone. In a sense, I'd like to think that the cost is due to substituting subtle flavors of the stated ingredients as opposed to an excessive amount of sugar, a concept alien enough to balance out the patriotism to neutral. To put it another way, if sweet was one's only taste receptor, this would be the Wonder Bread of ice cream and one's visit, especially if cultured in hype, is likely to result in a subsequent trip through the stages of grieving. If one is still reading, due to [excitement, cautious optimism] be sure to check out: - Real Mint Chip: I've simply never had ice cream that tasted like fresh mint before. - Desert Rose Honey: A nearly perfectly balanced tart yogurt that might ruin Cherry On Top, Golden Spoon, Red Mango, etc. forever. Disapproval and further illustrating the C. family comestible preference distance was worth coming here - I just hope it finds enough audience in a steakhouse-rife land.",4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"What a nice place! While in Charlotte visiting family, I decided to yelp a place to find a tasty birthday cake. After getting some sushi we drove down to Amelie's, and for a while I was concerned that we were headed in the wrong direction - the area was pretty sparse and industrial looking. But when we pulled up and I saw the cute little porch I knew it would be good. The interior is artsy and adorable, with a touch of class. I'm a big fan of the various chandeliers they had and of course - the sweets. What yummy looking sweets, served up by a friendly staff. I got a free eclair for it being my birthday, and chose a big fat chocolate cappucino/rum cream cake. Then we had some french pressed coffee. Overall, I'd say the sweets I had were decent, not amazing. The cake was a bit dry but still yum. If I'm ever in Charlotte again though I'll definitely have to bring some friends to this place, The atmosphere is simply lovely. The best part? It's open 24 hours.",4,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Quick tip: Cap'n Crunch ice cream- it's buttery rich and a nice balance of salty and sweet, plus the cereal is caramelized to add a deep burnt sugar flavor and keep it crunchy, because no one wants Cap'n Soggy. It's a five star craving just waiting to happen. I knew very little about the Sprinkles brand, except that it is the west coast favorite for cupcakes. Rather than do any research, I asked the Duchess what she orders here. When Jessica mentioned Cuban coffee cupcakes, I decided to bring my family here for a sweet treat right after I returned from a trip to Florida. We enjoyed walking around The Linq and seeing the observation wheel up close. My daughter had been pointing at those lights for weeks. I have to wonder where the creator of the Cuban coffee cupcake drinks their cafÃ© cubano, because I've never tasted Cuban coffee with cinnamon before. It tasted a lot like Mexican chocolate, and I loved the flavor and texture of the cake. I just don't think there was enough espresso flavor to even call it cafÃ© de olla. I would definitely order this again, but it is a special flavor, so it's available for a limited time. We didn't wait in line, but service at the counter was kind of slow. If you're impatient, you might try your luck outside at the Cupcake ATM. This may not be a convenient option if you find a crowd of people taking #cupcakeatmselfies! You have to go inside for ice cream. There's also Ghirardelli just a few feet away. What were they thinking? I recommend parking in the lot behind the observation wheel to avoid walking through the dreadful Imperial Palace. I know they renamed it The Q or something not very creative like that, but once you go behind the casino, it's still the Imperial Palace. We had fun playing air hockey and using the $1 massage chairs on the first floor of the IP parking garage, so I guess it's not the worst option.",4,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"Selection is super limited to a handful of items, but do yourself a favor a grab a million of the lobster tails yummy goodness--HELLO!!! The whole time I'm eating those darn little things I kept saying, ""this is interesting,"" which is a compliment to the baker! I love creamy desserts--add whipped cream, French cream, mascarpone and I instantly fall in love but man, these little lobster tails had me crunching away! Is it a philo dough over a croissant??? You bite into these little heavenly jewels, and you get this flaky crunch, then soft crescent, then light French cream. I mean who knew something so simple could just make you want to dance a happy dance???? if y'all know me, you know I can't order one thing in a bakery, so we added cheesecake, every flavor lobster tail, and a strawberry shortcake slice. Cheesecake was super awesome amazing. I don't like cheesecake ordinarily, but they were so pretty and petit, I had to try!!! It's a bold bakery that offers mini cheesecakes with no crust and a simple strawberry on top--hot damn it was good!!! Although I enjoyed the strawberry shortcake--I prefer a chiffon cake (from Candlelight Bakery) over a sponge. The lightness of the cream and tartness of fresh strawberries just always seem to go better with the airiness of a chiffon...all in all, the star of this visit were the lobster tails!! going back today before we leave Vegas to grab a box!!!",4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

They have a very, VERY, narrow ramp into the building for wheelchairs, if not caught just right, its possible to miss it with a wide wheel chair.

Besides amazing flavor, the Maiko special has so many ingredients that blend effortless well with each other. The toppings are layered so when you mix it all up you can get a mix of soft and crunchy in every bite or leave it as it is.

I asked my friend at the pub about Jeni's and they said totally worth it, so I went after my meal for dessert there. Thankfully, the line had died down a little bit. I have to say, from the minute you are greeted it's just a great experience! The friendliness of the staff, especially when you tell them it's your first time, is just fabulous! They let you sample to build your ""dream cone"" and make solid recs based on your tastes. I have to say, I was not disappointed when I devoured my cone!

"Coming from LA, particularly the 626 area, I am a frequent visitor at this store. I was visiting Vegas for a family birthday and decided to order the cake slices rather than a whole cake and settled for 85 since it was a familiar name. We placed our order an hour before the given pickup time and arrived around that time. When we arrived inside the first thing I noticed was a sewer stench and I thought I would get used to it but the 15+ mins we were there I did not (or does the plaza sell durian and I don't know about it..?). We went up to the pickup window and someone eventually helped us because it was so busy and the line was pretty long but that's ok. The thing that led me to write this review was that they did not have the order ready when we arrived so it took a much longer wait while they prepared it. We came in at the same time as someone else and I noticed they left way after us, so what was the point of having an online order function..? So we get dibs on the items? After we got our order and left for home we realized that the order was incorrect and they mixed up 2 items. It was our fault for not checking too but could our experience get any worse.. I don't blame the guy that put our order together but management should well.. manage better in terms of work flow and get on that online ordering issue. For all the folks that bother to read this, maybe skip out on online orders for now because you might have a better experience going into order.

"So, with this place receiving so much fanfare I had to stop in and see what all the fuss was about. I arrived when almost all the donuts were gone but still managed to score a dozen with the help of my good friend. We walked right in and were greeted by the friendly and fun staff. We viewed the menu for the day and could not believe the variety of donuts. There were at least 20+ flavors to choose from and this included vegan choices which I can totally get behind. These aren't just donuts, some were like mini cakes and were almost big enough to cover your whole face (No Joke)! I had never seen such large donuts before and could not believe how creative these people are with the large variety of choices. We managed to score some delicious options, such as the Strawberry Split, Mexican Hot Chocolate, Blood Orange, Boston Creme, The Oreo Donut (with an Oreo inside) and a couple of creme brÃ»lÃ©e'. My favorite donut from this batch was the Boston Creme. The creme oozes with flavor and tasted heavenly. The donut itself was moist and fresh. The creme was so rich that I found it a little overwhelming to eat in one sitting so I ate half the first day and finished it off the second day. Yeah, it was rough.... The Strawberry Split was layered with fresh strawberries and whipped creme in the middle of a large sugar donut. A different take on the strawberry short cake and perhaps a step up. I almost added a small drizzle of chocolate since I had it for dessert that night. I shared the other donuts with my staff and family and they were all very complimentary. My daughter really liked the Oreo Donut and was surprised when she found the cookie in the middle. The service was outstanding and so friendly. The shop is quaint and very clean with not a whole lot of room and it makes this place nice and cozy. They also have a new t- shirt for advertising that is available for purchase. It has a great color scheme and it gives a shout out to our city! I can hardly wait to go back early in the morning when the donuts are fresh out of the fryer. I think I can hear a Homer donut calling my name.",4,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown
"Ordered a chicken salad sandwich, random macaroons, tea cake and salted caramel brownie. Sandwich was mediocre, as expected though since it seems like sandwiches aren't the reason people show up here. The macaroons were good, hold the cinnamon chocolate one though, it was trash. Mixed berry, pistachio and whatever the purple was were very good. GF had the brownie and cake since they were Gluten-Free. She didn't die so I guess they were good. Would come back again if I was in the area or drunk. I can understand why this place would be popular at night. Missing a star for rushed ordering if you don't know the menu.

"3.75 stars. Croissant: crisp and buttery, but not the best I've had. It might have been better if I'd had it earlier in the day. Pain au chocolat: Again good, but not the best. The chocolate had never fully melted and the croissant was on the dry side. Pain epi with butter and cherry preserves: A great deal at $1.75. Pretty crusty, but in a way that I like. I'm not sure what kind of butter it was, but it was very good, as were the cherry preserves. This was my favorite item. Lemon Macaron: I have only had macarons a couple of times, and I'm not sure I'm a fan, so I don't think I'm the best judge of this. The texture was light and crisp on the outside, then chewy, then gooey in the middle. I think it's the goo I don't like. I've had some very good pastries, so I judge pretty harshly. If you are visiting from an area that doesn't have as many options, I would highly recommend checking this out. These are made right, and this is probably among the top 5 bakeries I have been to. It was lovely to have this available right near the guest elevators.",4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
We waited in line for about half an hour - likely because everyone inside is taste testing all their flavors. It's new so that's to be expected. Since Publix sells their pints now I had a general idea of what to expect. I knew I wanted to try a flavor that wasn't available at the grocery store. I ended up with cream puff and in order to let the people behind me get their flavors faster I didn't try any other flavor. I got it in a cup because I was quite full from dinner at copper and I think a waffle cone would have really pushed me over the edge. The flavor was super light and fresh. The one scoop was perfect for me since I was pretty full. We sat outside and people watched. Pretty legit evening. The servers were nice and accommodating. They also sell boxed water and I was super thirsty so bought that. They sell pints there for $12. Would not recommend buying a pint there if the flavor is available at Publix because the pints at Publix are only $8.,4,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown

"I love coming to Mason's! It is a different atmosphere from Mitchell's and feels more cozy and small-business like. It is at such a cute corner and I adore the fact about their small batches of ice cream. It allows them to be really creative with their flavors and I get to try things like cinnamon toast crunch ice cream or taro or black sesame. I appreciate the more ""asian"" flavors because it is not something that is common, and I often can't get it unless I go to a frozen section of an asian specialty grocery store. It does not taste as creamy and sweet as other ice cream, but I think I like the milder flavor. Overall a cute place that I would definitely return to for its cool and interesting flavors and cozyness!

"Pro-tip: Expect a line. There's no place to eat inside. They offer samples. You can split one scoop into two mini scoops for more flavors. For the floats, they give you the rest of the soda in the bottle/can. Highlights: The pricing is really affordable for someone who wants a double or triple scoop since one scoop is $5 and it's only $1 more for 2x the ice cream or $2 more for 3x the ice cream. The ice cream is good quality and the flavors are distinct as well. Lowlights: It would be nice if they had indoor seating or even a larger space so people in line don't have to wait outside in the heat. They only have 12 flavors and a lot of them are the basic chocolate/vanilla/butter pecan type of flavors.",4,Positive,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,Negative,Negative,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown

Before paying, the gentleman showed us the boxes and asked if it looked correct, upon examining the items we informed him that the order was not correct. Another 20 minutes went by and finally the cashier called us over, I asked her what was inside the boxes and explained how the first time around the order was screwed up, her response to me was ""I don't know, read the receipt"" (how rude!!

"Promised my daughter I would take her here to try the nutella donut she has been dying to sink her teeth into. Came in on a Saturday morning around 11am to find a small line of about 5 people formed waiting to place their orders. Donuts are priced individually. Picked up two nutella overloads, one strawberry cheesecake and one toasted coconut; total came to $13. Nutella Overload: Nothing to call home about. In my opinion, there was no 'overload' of nutella present. This donut is basically a nutella-filled donut with powdered sugar dusted heavily on top. Strawberry Cheesecake: This is a jelly filled donut (I believe strawberry jelly - hence the strawberry in the name), with a glazed topping and a dusting pile of what I believe is graham crackers. I don't get any cheesecake from this donut, so I don't know why they find the need to call it a strawberry cheesecake donut. Toasted Coconut: An old fashion cake donut with toasted coconut on top. If you like coconut, you will enjoy the coconut topping. Overall, these donut were not terrible but they were not donuts that I 'gotta have' next time in Vegas. Side note - there is metered parking right in front of the business which only takes credit cards.

Can't get enough of this place. Wish they had another location this place is always pack and very hard to find parking. This is located in a big plaza with dozen of other restaurants.

While the flavors weren't clearly labeled, a staffer was patient in explaining which ones were which. As for the donuts themselves, the ones I chose were on the airier side (that is, not dense and old-fashioned), but were at least delightful bursts of glaze that resulted in a sugar high.

The staff is fantastically friendly and, unless they are swamped, will spare a minute to talk to friendly faces.

I split the three pack of cake truffles with my husband and a friend and we all collectively agreed they are way, way, way too sweet. ""Immediate stomach ache"" too sweet. Hard pass, would not repurchase or recommend. The corn cookie was more my jam! Less sweet, was soft and slightly chewy. Subtle corn flavor. I was kind of let down that it was pre-packaged. For $3/cookie, even for the strip, I would kind of appreciate if they at least had the appearance of being fresh baked and maybe even warm it for you if requested (because really, there are not many things more comforting than a warm cookie).

"I'll admit I goofed, there are not enough pictures below to display the beauty of all the things I've tried at Milk Bar (in Vegas and NYC). Honestly I just got too excited to eat and missed the photo-op. Here's to hoping I can describe it better! Cookies: Unpopular opinion, I think the cookies are underwhelming. I've tried the compost, the corn flake chocolate chip marshmallow, and the blueberry and cream. None of them were memorable. Honestly recommend skipping all cookies and saving as much room for cakes and pies as possible. Pie: What is crack pie? I don't even know, it's got a crispy oat crust and a not overly sweet but perfectly balanced buttery filling. It's ooey and gooey, I don't know how it's made, I'm not sure what's in it other then butter, but I ate it and I loved it, I urge you to do the same. Cake balls: I always thought cake balls were a little basic, I've tried them a few times and was never wowed. I WAS WOWED here y'all. The chocolate malt cake ball tastes like a soft, very rich and indulgent creamy fudge brownie. I don't know how they got it so perfect. It's a revelation. Cakes: Dear lord sweet baby Jesus, these cakes are BOMB. I've tried the bday cake and the pumpkin pie cake. The bday one I actually made in a Milk Bar class in NYC, so I got to see how they assemble them. The level of detail they put in to making each layer perfect is incredible. Cake, soak, icing, crunchy element. They hit every note. Definitely recommend the seasonal pumpkin cake while it lasts, the pumpkin ganache layer mixed with the graham cracker cheesecake layer- I died.

"I stumbled upon this place last night. I can't believe what I heard from the owner. The outstanding folks from SuperFarm SuperTruck make more than just their amazing Superfarm ice cream...no no no...they make a whole slew of flavors. Guess who has them? YUP! Lets Melt down to the specifics and discuss the new gem ice cream shop, Melt. ~The Good~ Well, the owner is good buddies with the owner of Superfarm. I just realized Udder Delights is also under their tree of ice creameries...so if you like Udder Delights, check this place out! I just love the randomness of it all. A guy opens up a small, nondescript ice cream literally next to Lost Leaf, and he just so happens to have local, amazingly tasty ice cream from Superfarms...GO FIGURE!!! They have a ton of flavors, by the way. Right now they have a ton of sherbets and fruit-flavored ice creams. Of course they have the usual staples like chocolate, mint chocolate, and so on....but come on, they have Superfarm, which if you have yet to have it, is a hazelnut chocolate ice cream, with Nutella added. This ice cream alone is a reason to come here. Instead of tracking down Superfarm's truck or heading to Gilbert for your fix, COME HERE! The owner's also, are very relaxed, its a small business to the T. They also make smoothies out of the farm-fresh ice creams they have. Just come and try this joint, you will love it. ~The Bad~ There really isn't too much. It is not in the nicest building, its in a re-designed home, the kind your used to at Roosevelt row. They do not have seating inside, so it may get hot if eating out in the sun. Its more of a cash n' dash if eating during the day. I see this more of an optimal spot for later in the night, if you ask me. Its in Roosevelt Row, and that is not everyone's cup of tea. If you are the person that like add-ons and toppings, they do not offer that to this point, so keep that in mind if that is a must-have. ~The Down Low~ Overall, this is a solid 4 star spot. The amazingly kind and homely (the good kind) service, assortment of flavors, freshness of ingredients, and the fact that the ice cream is locally made all add up to 4 stars. Is it a swanky parlor where hipsters go to? No. Is it a shop that serves ONLY local and fresh farm-made ingredients? YES. Even most local in-house shoppes fail to use such fresh sources. Melt is also open from 12 to 12...ALL DAY..So you can get your Melt on whenever you want! Melt gets the Jefe Seal of Approval!

I learned about the owners and what it takes to make ice cream. Disclosure: I am not an ice cream aficionada but I do like to eat it sparingly. On my latest visit, I was on a vegan diet so I ordered two of their sorbets: chocolate and strawberry. They complemented each other well and were refreshing and tasty. The strawberry tasted fresh and had seeds in it, while the chocolate reminded me of froyo, a lighter version. Service was friendly and employees were wearing masks, no seating available. Glad they're doing well and hope they're staying safe.",5,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"Delicious pastries at an affordable price. I love that there's an 85 degree bakery in Las Vegas as I've been going to the OC location since forever. Each pastry is individually wrapped and you use tongs to grab your choices which I think is a great way to prevent germs. My favorite is the choco bun and egg tarts. Most the items are relatively cheap and I believe are under $3. They have whole or sliced cakes for sale but I feel they look better than they taste. The sea salt ice coffee is a must. I recommend coming in, ordering a drink first at the kiosk and then pick and pay for your desserts because it takes a while for them to make drinks. Line can get long here but unless you order drinks the line moves very fast.",4,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown
"This place definitely has a lot of hype surrounding it, but I would have to say it is just another tourist trap. The lines are about 1-2 hours depending on the time of day and day of the week you arrive. I guess it is part of the experience, but for a local, I don't find that very appealing or any thing that I would want to do on a weekly/monthly basis. It took us about an hour or so to get in last night and when we finally did we were served by a very friendly set of employees. We bought a mini chocolate cannoli, a pastry called a lobster tail, a cheesecake, and a Carmel cupcake. The best of the 4 was the lobster tail, it is a crunchy pastry filled with a cream that was definitely enjoyable. The cannoli was very gritty and I will probably not purchase it again if I were to return. The Carmel cupcake was mediocre at best and not worth the wait when there are places that specialize in amazing cupcakes all around the strip. The cheesecake was good, but for $11 you can get that anywhere on the strip at a larger size and better quality. We always try these tourists traps as locals just so we can see if they meet the hype, but with the long wait and price attached to all we got, I don't see myself standing in this line again.",3,Negative,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,Positive,Negative,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown
"So I went to the Milk Bar after accidentally stumbling upon it on my way to Secret Pizza after the club but Milk Bar was already closed. Thankfully about a year ago I had seen their episode on Netflix that the baker got so I knew I had to make the trek back! I walked 30mins round trip for some pastries TWICE and they didn't disappoint! The team was so accommodating! They allowed me to make edits to my greatest hit box (I can't do ice cream because of my gastric bypass surgery.) The cornflake-chocolate-chip-marshmallow was warmed for me by them and it was exquisite! It also came with the B'd cake truffle and it was life changing! The staff also helped answer a ton of my questions in regards to the cakes, sizes, & prices and even got me a frozen cake to far better on the flight home. The staff at Milk Bar LV are extremely kind and welcoming and the food is everything your middle school heart imagined adulthood would taste like.

There is a huge assortment of pastries and desserts. If you can't find something to enjoy you just must not be trying. The seating is a bit bizarre especially if you are trying to sit a group.

"Pretty sure this donut changed my life - for the much better. I LOVE these - Mexican hot chocolate is my favorite, I don't know why it's better than the regular chocolate or the Nutella, but for me it is the best. Blood orange is good, really liked the blueberry lemon, and bc I am a health nut - the Cadbury egg inside the Easter donut. Actually scratch all this - the Homer is the best. And the fritter. Damn, just order a dozen and wear your sweats, these donuts are amazing. I got these for my last birthday instead of a cake. Sent my friend down to get the Easter donuts. Came for Mother's Day... you get the picture. The location is great, you can go to the vintage stores on Main Street or walk Fremont. They have a garden, a donut aquarium, cute art on the walls, nice staff, Chef Jeff is usually there, OH, and banging coffee.

I stayed at the Venetian Hotel and Casino for one major reason. Thomas freaking Keller! Whether I was dining at Bouchon Bistro or snacking on treats from Bouchon Bakery, I followed Keller like a fly on a horse's butt! First trip consisted of one of there famous macaroons which I didn't see what the fuss was. I got the vanilla flavor but maybe they only taste good when they first bring them down because mine was a little on the stale side. While the vanilla cream inside was good the stale outside just ruined it. Second trip was a little more successful. I ended with the famous Thomas Keller's version of a Nutter Butter and a freshly baked Chocolate Donut with a custard filling. The Nutter Butter was good, much better than the cookie, with a peanut butter cookie on the outside and delicious peanut butter on the inside making it a perfect little treat! Move over Dunkin Donuts because I run on Thomas Keller's Donuts. Perfectly shaped donut with a wonderful custard feeling with chocolate icing and chocolate sprinkles on top. MMMMMM Donut was the only thing that kept popping in my head while eating it! If I had a Bouchon Bakery near me I would be the size of a whale. Third trip was my favorite. I got the Carrot Cake Cookie. It tasted so fresh and moist and looks just like that big cookie in the movie ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids"" that the ants were eating on. Hopefully ya'll know what I'm talking about. Just like the ants I couldn't get enough. It had that nice little spice that carrot cake has with a wonderful cream inside that reminded me of the cream in those oatmeal cookies I got growing up in my school lunches. Just a perfect cookie! Last and final trip, a tear slowly ran down my eyes while I made my final purchase, was Red Velvet Cupcake with a Citrus Frosting. While cheesecake is my favorite desert, red velvet is my second and this cupcake is the reason why. I got it as soon as they came down from baking, it was perfectly moist with a wonderfully rich cream cheese feeling inside a nice citrus frosting on top with a cute little smiley face made of chocolate chips reminding me it was Halloween. It was very rich but very good! All I can say is thank you Thomas Keller for being the genius you are and making my trip oh so sweet!",5,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"Amazing lemon basil sorbet!! It was super tangy, not too sweet and just a hint of basil. My bf had bourbon caramel ice cream and said it was over the top delicious.

The owner kept offering sample after sample without tire.

"On my first visit to Madison, WI we enjoyed walking around the city and the University of Wisconsin campus. After a long day of walking around we were craving ice cream. We heard there was ice cream shops around the campus that had cream made from local cows. We were pointed in the direction of State Street where we found Chocolate Shoppe Ice Cream. As soon as we walked in the place was busy and kind of organized into two lines to order. The heat was blaring in there and it was a little uncomfortable to stand in the building. There were only 2 people working behind the counter and they were doing an awesome job, but it was clearly under staffed for the volume of customers. After 25 minutes of standing in line we finally ordered. The ice cream was amazing! We enjoyed taking the ice cream outside and sitting and looking at the view of the capital down State Street.

"WOW. This place is clean and trendy. The people behind the counter are incredibly polite and patient and friendly! I sampled nearly every flavor quite shamelessly. Here are a few standouts: White Chocolate Raspberry: white chocolate ice cream in the same tub as raspberry sorbet. delicious and creamy combined with sweet and tart...two flavors for the price of one! i really loved this, but those who aren't a fan of white chocolate may not as much. Salted Caramel: the lady said this was their most popular flavor, so of course I had to have some. it was delicious and rich and creamy with perfect caramel flavor! Cashew Turtle: Delicious ice cream with their yummy homemade brittle. i'm salivating right now. White Roses: pure and sweet. what a sensation. Basis Lime: this was a real kick in the pants! sweet and tart and incredibly refreshing! Cheese Course Duo: This is incredibly creamy. At first it tastes sweet and nutty with the dates, then the cheese flavor kicks in. i found it pretty disconcerting at first, but after a few bites i was hooked! Brownie Swirl: you can't go wrong with brownies! this homemade gourmet version just knocked the classic out of the park for me! The housemade brittle and cones were all fresh and tasty! my sister got an ice cream sandwich with chocolate ice cream, which i nibbled. it was fantastic. i can't wait to come here again!",5,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown
"When you want soft-serve ice cream in Pittsburgh, this is where to go! In addition to the usual vanilla and chocolate you'd find at most places, Page's has a slew of other flavors like orange, mint chocolate chip, amaretto, pumpkin, and many more! You really can't go wrong with any soft serve flavor. It seems that these flavors rotate depending on the season as well; for instance, pumpkin only appears on the menu in the fall. I tend to stick to the simple small cone, but they have a huge variety of sundaes and other ways to enjoy the many soft serve flavors. Not to mention, they have a few savory food items too, which I have yet to try. The lines are long, but don't let that stop you because the wait is worth it.

Very cool! I picked up 2 of their little cakes to take back home. The vegan chocolate one was really good. The cake itself was delicious and not too dry as some vegan cake variations can sometimes be. I would definitely have their chocolate vegan cake again and would like to try more of their cakes! The other cake I got for my friend was their lavender cake with honey buttercream. My friend said it was delicious as well. The shop itself is very cute and has a vintage vibe to it.

Came by before I realized they even had their grand opening so I realize they're still ironing things out. However, the Hawaiian chicken that I got lacked toppings. Their cakes, however, are on point. I didn't give them five stars due to the poor customer service. I understand that they're still in soft opening phase but the drink I received was wrong from the one I ordered/reflected on my receipt. When I pointed it out, the man serving drinks tried to lie and say that they only charged me for the regular mountain green tea when I was clearly charged 3.45 for the sea salt mountain green tea. Additionally, it listed ""SSALT MT"" instead of apologizing, he took my drink and just added sea salt on top despite it being already cold so the consistency won't be right. It's supposed to be milk tea-esque and mix when it's hot so I was very disappointed. I saw that they were very busy so I didn't push the issue further but it's something they can work on- apologizing to the customer when they've made a mistake!",2,Positive,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

I didn't get her name but the sweet young lady that helped me was very knowledgeable and suggested I get the matcha coffee. She was even kind enough to Google items that we were unsure had gluten in it. I really appreciated her assistance and I will definitely go back again! Oh yeah and I got two matcha coffees.

"My childhood was punctuated with trips to the chocolate shoppe to buy children's poison which makes them hysterical, I mean blue moon. Oh how I loved the blue staining delight. We stopped in this summer and had a horrible experience. We were under the impression that cones were 50 cents because of the promotional poster on the window. Upon asking (politely I may add) why the price difference, we were met with yelling. Not loud talking but yelling. When my husband said that we would still buy it, the gentlemen in his 50's, dumped the ice cream back into the bucket. That sucked. We left. And while I can never be sure, I do have my hunches that if my husband was white, we would have been treated differently.

"Really good cupcakes. Really expensive cupcakes. Deducted one star for cost/benefit. I enjoyed the cupcakes that I tried and even brought home an half dozen. Traditional and unique flavor combinations and a very dense cake batter mix make for a rich and satisfying cupcake. The fact they are almost $4 a piece (and they are about the size of a standard cupcake; I realize that's a subjective statement, but think of a cupcake wrapper you buy at the grocery store, same size here) make for a double take. My favorite was the chocolate and peanut butter combo. That and the chilled $3 bottle of 8.75 oz of Pellegrino was a nice respite from the Vegas heat.

I emailed Carlo's Bakery letting them know. Took forever to get a response. When I did, they said someone from the location contact me. No one did. I emailed again. Someone emailed offering to sent me the gift card sleeves, even after I advised that I had given the gift. The last email advised that they were sending me the sleeves and two coupons for a free cannoli! To be used at any location! Yeah! Wait...I live in CA & there is no location here.

"But really, I think Presti's was the best cannoli I've ever had in my life. Also, i've never had so many handsome men offer to hold the door for me (why I am not spending more time in Little Italy?), but, I digress. There's also a few free parking spots directly in front of the bakery (score!). Presti's really does have it all. I love the high-energy environment and open space concept. When I visited, there was a wonderful mix of students, business folks on lunch breaks, and diverse and intergenerational people overall spread amongst the tables working, studying and having coffee chats. This immediately made my heart really happy to see so many different people coming together. When I walked in, I immediately grabbed a number and waited for it to be called. The cases were packed immaculately with everything-- cinnamon buns, cheesecakes, creme brulee, brownies, custard puff, cassata cake... literally anything you can imagine to entice you while you wait your turn. It was a little busy when I visited, so I ended up getting a cannoli to-go while my friend opted for the cassata cake. There's probably not words to appropriately describe this cannoli-- but the filling was so fresh, creamy and unique. I feel like I could pick it out of a lineup. I tried a bite of my friends' cassata cake, and it was layered to perfection without being overly sugary. Sometimes cassata cake can be a lost art when the cream/frosting is a suger overload, but this one was perfect. Overall, I don't really think you can go wrong with anything here.

Most of the time I'm the first one awake so one of the mornings that I went across to the Venetian from TI to grab some coffee I found this place. The pastries looked fantastic but I can't say how they were because I never sampled or tasted any. The coffee was alright, and the staff was nice. The bakery itself is pretty tiny, at least the one that I visited was. There's really no room to sit so you just grab your order and take it outside or back to your hotel room. In the mornings there was a very smelly homeless man hanging out in the Venetian bridge/skywalk lobby right outside the bouchon.

"Saw a bunch of my friends posting about Fatty Daddy's and had a late night craving for some ice cream so here I go. We got there right around closing time but service was still excellent and they let us sample some flavors. Originally wanted banana but after trying the lucky charms, we were hooked. Was recommended to pair it with a fruity pebbles macaron and I was in heaven. Ice cream had some unique flavors and was very rich and creamy. The macaron was also perfect not hard but still nice and chewy. Would love to go back and try some other flavors. They gave me a stamp card with some extra stamps on it so I'll definitely be back.",5,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive
"I stumbled upon Momofuku & Milk Bar side-by-side at the Cosmo & thought I'd hit my head & woken up on the other coast. This is the furthest west I've ever seen these New York staples. For old times sake & because I love giving into unhealthy habits, I ordered a slice of Crack Pie. Served cold, the tiny, flat triangle flavored of butterscotch (& other sweet flavors I can't pinpoint) packs a sweet wallop for its size.

"Sinful Sweets is making it easier than ever to give into temptation by opening a second location on Liberty Avenue. So whichever corner of downtown you're visiting, they more or less have you covered now! All of the things you like about the Penn Ave location apply to the new one, except that this place is much more of a ""grab and go"" spot (while the original shop has some limited seating available). Milkshakes? Got 'em. Cookies? Check. Chocolate covered cookies? Yep! Truffles? Roger. Cupcakes? Go ahead and order a boxful. And there is of course a whole host of other assorted sweet treats, too. I just left with a chocolate covered oatmeal creme pie and a chocolate chip whoopie pie. I suspect they will need some time to get into their grove, especially based on what I saw tonight: one lone staffer holding down the fort (and doing pretty well, actually) as Pirates fans flock into downtown.

I'm not sure if the NYC location makes the cookies and pies fresh, but the cookie I got here was pre-packaged and kinda tasted old. Not gross - just kinda hard, dry, and meh. The cookie tasted like one you would get from your average grocery store bakery. Crack pie - good, not great. Kinda a small piece for the price. Truffles - really sweet, but good. These were probably my fave of the baked goods. The ice cream was my favorite of all. If I came again I would just stick to the ice cream only. It's so weird, but it does taste exactly like cereal milk! I don't know why I thought it wouldn't though. I liked the salty/sweet flavors of the cereal with the ice cream.

"You've probably heard of places to die for so this place is definitely a place to live for LOL :D In all seriousness, it's quite embarrassing that it's taken me this long to finally write a review for an amazing bakery that is probably the best bakery in my opinion in Charlotte. Okay so this place is kinda inconspicuous when I drove by because I almost missed it and its very possible depending on which direction you're heading in. When you get there it's only 1 customer allowed in the shop so there might be a line but you'll always see people carry boxes of sweet treats! That's always a good sign from the multiple times I've been here! Once I got it, holy guacomole! My eyes got big and my tongue started to salivate from all the goodies that were available. They had cookies, macarons, cheesecakes, cannolis, and so many different things. They don't do dessert small here, more like loaded! I was so shocked at how big the cookies were like it could be the size of your whole fist! I've gotten macarons, cannolis, cookies, etc. They are all amazing but the one thing I have to recommend getting here is the tiramisu and creme puffs that are out of this world! I have a big sweet tooth and love dessert but man those 2 knocked it out of the park with how flavorful it was. Not too sweet but just the right amount like goldilocks haha Price wise it was very fair and the ladies at the counter will help you if you have any questions with a great attitude! I would say take your time here and just a get a few things because it all adds up $$$ real fast and same for the calories lol I'd say make it a trip and try something new each time you're nearby and they surely will not disappoint! Parking-wise is super easy since it's an open lot but there are a lot rocks so heads up if one gets stuck in your tire.

Now that not-as-little me can drive, I'm shocked that I don't go here more. Honey Hut is the most consistently delicious ice cream in Cleveland. A hot take for some, but I stand by it. Not once have I gone here and not been pleased with the flavor I picked, the price, and welcoming atmosphere of this little stand. This time around, I got the featured flavor - banana chocolate chip. Just banana-y enough and tasted impressively fresh. My mom went for the classic honey pecan flavor. This flavor is always a winner in my book. While it is incredibly sweet, the nut pieces balance it out and make you take your time rather than consuming it in two seconds flat. My sister got chocolate peanut butter.

"Why am I giving Sweet Republic 3 stars? Here's the lowdown: They get 5 stars for their unique and tasty icecream flavors. One of which was the bacon flavored icecream. Who would of thought? Bacon icecream. Their fruit flavors are VERY refreshing and true to taste. They get -2 stars for their customer service. Long story short...About 6 of us went to Sweet Republic, one of my girlfriends ordered an icecream sandwich. She didn't like the sandwich because it was harder than rocks. She asked if she could just switch it to a small cup of icecream and one of the Owners (don't know her name) literally threw (with more force than necessary) the sandwich into the garbage can. Awkward! After my friend switched to plain icecream, the Owner asked ""Did you try it before?"", sounding like the Owner didn't want to be burdened again with an exchange. I just feel they should be more graceful about accepting things back, especially since we didn't want money back. Anyway, If you love dessert, this place is great.

The cornflake topping helped the taste, but without it the soft serve was very bland.

"After visiting the Bouchon Bakery in Napa Valley, I just had to visit the one in Las Vegas when I was there. I brought my friends along because they wanted to see the huge macaroons. Be careful though because the place is pretty difficult to find (I even had trouble with the directions given by the Venetian associates). The only thing I purchased at this Bouchon Bakery was the full set of MACAROONS (a total of six pieces). NOTE: If you buy 5 macaroons, you get 1 free. The macaroons were about $3.50 each. I purchased a pre-packaged set of six macaroons, which containedVANILLA, PISTACHIO, RASPBERRY, COFFEE/CAPPUCHINO, CHOCOLATE (brownie?), AND A SPECIAL BOUCHON FLAVOR. Truthfully, since they were pre-packaged, I'm assuming the macaroons were made that day hopefully rather than the day before. Just to be safe, for anyone purchasing six, one of each flavor, go with the regular boxing where they grab the fresh ones made. I wanted to bring it home to Orange County to enjoy with my boyfriend, so I stuck it in the trunk and drove on home with the others. Need I remind you it was summer, but I never would have thought anything would have happened to the macaroons, sensitive creatures they are. Sad to say, never ever leave your macaroons out in heat, even if it's not in direct sunlight. Room temperature is best. Why? Because when I opened the truck, my poor chocolate/brownie macaroon sort of melted and oozed out this liquid and traveled down the box and ruined my other macaroons. Some were also cracked already (dang, sensitive pastries)!!! They all looked horrific by now, so I dare not show them to my boyfriend. As a result, I enjoyed them by myself. :) :) :) Hahaha. Anyways, onto the review of the tastings and enough of my ranting. In the end, I prefer the Napa Valley Bouchon over this one. Overall, all the flavors were actually perfect and light. The only thing I have to say about the CHOCOLATE/BROWNIE macaroon was that it was a little too dense and chocolatey (probably because of the melting though). My favorites were the VANILLA and PISTACHIO. The coffee one was alright. If you like coffee flavored pastries, you might like this one. As for the RASPBERRY, I never got to taste it. *sobs* I accidentally left it out and the dang ants got to them. This was a bad luck batch of macaroons is all I'm saying.

"After reading an article in Charlotte Agenda about Ninety's Macaroon Ice Cream Sandwiches I had to have one! I live very close to Ninety's and never knew that they offered so much here. But I stayed on my mission to get a macaroon ice cream sandwich. There was so many flavors it was hard to choose from (even though Ive heard the Birthday cake is the best) but since I am all about pumpkin right now I chose the Pumpkin flavor. Not to be mistaken with the Pumpkin Bread, there is a difference smh! The Macaroon sandwich is huge! They offer to cut it in half but I decided to take mine to go. This ice cream sandwich was amazing!! and everything I hoped it to be! The macaroon is totally a macaroon and is flaky per usual. The ice cream was great as well! It taste exactly like pumpkin. It was a little bit too much for me, I definitely could not finish the whole sandwich but it would be perfect to possibly share.

The donuts were hard and the store offer a lot of candies you can typically buy in any store but pretty much 3 times the price. But if you are truly having a sugar fit you can buy it here no complains. The way you can get lured into here is the colorful ambience and the way the store is design. Its almost the candy house of from Hansel and Gretel in the middle of the forest but this one is inside the grand canal shops. They have other nice props that are cute that are for sale at the store too. Oh yeah, they also have the nice Chanticleer that is for sale for 300 something, pretty nice!

The staff does a wonderful job and the line moves fast. I've had sandwiches, coffees, teas, and lots of macaroons and other desserts at all locations. Yet this location was the first and is by far my favorite because of the decor. The macaroons are soft and delicious as they should be, they have some flavors year round with seasonal flavors. Tonight I had the pumpkin and it was so good. I bit into it before I realized I needed to stop and take a picture. The pumpkin e-something dessert was amazing! With a nice surprise of caramel falling out much like a lava cake. Yum yum yum. My least favorite was the sweet potato torte with pecans that my friend ordered. But I'm a huge fan of pumpkin. So if you prefer sweet potato over pumpkin like my friend does, then you will love it. The best thing about this location colors to the other three locations is the parking lot.

We were able to try some samples and I'm glad we did. The cereal milk flavor was very surprising to me. It tasted like soggy cereal milk without tasting the cereal bits. The first taste is also a bit salty...? I was really taken aback with this taste and disappointed because I thought it would taste really good. We also tried their crack pie flavor which is a brown sugar custard. That was slightly better but I just expected a bit more taste and more flavors.

Notice the highlighted ARTISIANAL: Helen & Jan, the Goddess' of Ice Cream, pay more attention, dedication, and innovation; to the quality and purity of their ingredients then most restaurants claiming themselves as fine dining today. The flavor combinations of their ever changing roster are so consistently, mind blowingly intriguing and succesfully palate enlightening, as to have single handedly elevated ice-cream to a new plateau. Heavenly. Whether you opt for such gastronomical adventures as Rochefort & Dates, Classics like Vanilla Bean, or something in between like Apple Pie & Mojito, you will fall in love. Foodie Agape (thats true love, ya know) Even if you decide a particular flavor is not for you, you will sit in awe and adoration at the fact that they dared to go where no ice cream shop has ever gone before...

"835 reviews and a 5 star rating speaks for itself. Try Novel out and you'll see why! Tucked away in a Phoenix neighborhood, as mentioned, parking CAN be difficult/limited. The Thursday night we went we had no problem. They are currently doing ordering at the little window; you cannot go inside. They are still doing samples which is a great way to try all the yummy and unique flavors! I believe the flavors rotate daily (don't quote me on that). Besides classic scoops, you can have a doughnut melt or the Leslie Knope which is iced cream sandwiched in a waffle! *mind blown* You can also order a float! The butter pecan is HEAVENLY and rich. The bourbon caramel toffee crunch really does taste of bourbon but not overpoweringly so. The fat Elvis (peanut butter ice cream, honey, and bacon) really tastes like peanut butter if that's your thing! (But it's not mine).

"Donut Bar is one of the best places for breakfast. It has to be breakfast. They're only open until the donuts sell out. Most days they're out of them early. They also have coffee and vegan versions. It doesn't have official hours. It usually opens about 8 in the morning. They're only open until they sell out, which depending on how busy they are can be soon after they open. It's not a big place, and there's usually a line waiting out the door. The best thing you can do is get there soon after they open. I like the apple fritter. It's about $2 each. This is massive. It's crispy and not excessively sweet, and it goes good with coffee. This donut is also vegan. It usually has several vegan options. They also have donuts with Oreos and Twix bars in them. It doesn't have that much room inside. It only has a few seats against the wall where you can use an outlet.

"My family and u had a trip planned to Phoenix for months. Luckily 2 days before we left for Phoenix, I saw the Ice Creamy episode of The Best Thing I Ever Ate. The Toffee Bonafi (which was featured in the episode) is a MUST try! The vanilla ice cream is so creamy & full of vanilla-flavor. The salted caramel is the perfect combination of salty & sweet. The almond brittle, which also perfectly salty & sweet, added a crunch factor in contrast to the soft banana. Include a little of everything on your spoon, along with some lightly sweetened whipped cream and you'll feel like you're in heaven. I also had the pleasure of tasting my daughter's watermelon sorbet (which my husband said is the best watermelon sorbet he's ever had). My husband chose a scoop of Almond Buttercrunch and Belgian Chocolate in waffle cone. Both were just as creamy as the vanilla I had and just as delicious! Yup, you heard right, the watermelon sorbet had a creamy texture!

I opted for the slice of confetti cake and boy was I disappointed! $16 for a small slice of dry, crumbly cake with no flavor!

"I have always wanted a birthday cake from the famous carlos bakery. We moved her just before my 40th bday. I was so excited, I told my mom and husband that is the cake i wanted, a carlos bakery cake. I showed him a picture from a visit before that I wanted. He got me the beach cake. I was so excited. When he got home, half the top of the decorations had slid off the top and down the side. It looked horrible and my husband felt horrible. But who cares, lets dive into to the yummy cake. Not!! The fondant peeled off the cake rather than through it when cut. Tasted nasty and plain and hard. The cake was barely tasteful to eat. Never saw 1 part of the rave of carlos bakery cakes I have heard about forever. We didn't even want to finish it, we threw half of it away. I would have rather had a $10 cake from the store rather than this nasty little runny cake for $50.

"Everything that comes out of Mason's is a delight, and it's rare to visit without sampling something you never thought could be delicious as ice cream - think Froot Loops Cereal Milk or Whiskey Eggnog. This is not the place you go in and order simple chocolate or vanilla, though there's always a trade-standard-equivalent for those who refuse to challenge their tastes. Even better? They make everything from scratch, right there, and sometimes on-demand: if you really adore a flavor and don't mind buying it in bulk, put in an order any time of year and over a few days they'll mix up a batch just for you to take home and enjoy. I haven't yet availed myself of this only for fear that I'll take it home, lock the door and feedbag the whole thing in one sitting. I've been a devotee of Mason's since they were the friendly folks with the stand at the nascent Cleveland Flea; Jesse and Helen are what I would describe as a chill-power-couple.

"On Saturday 7th 2022, I stopped in about 1 - 2PM to get coffee with my sister and mother who are from out of town. The line was nearly out the door and we looked at each other questioning if waiting would be worth our time. I looked around at the fun dÃ©cor and told my family Amelie's is a Charlotte small business worth the experience. It took about twenty minutes to get to the counter which we understood given it was your opening weekend in my neighborhood. The person at the register was kind and helped us order our coffee. They explained if we want pastries, then we can pay at the end after we select them. People behind us had not ordered coffee so naturally they walked around us to order pastries. As we walked in their direction they apologized and said they weren't sure what to do. We said it was no matter and that they should go ahead. We both stood there for several minutes while no one helped or acknowledged us even though we had already paid, our drinks were getting cold, and we had waited in line nearly half an hour. Up until this point, everything was acceptable. Next, an employee directed guests from behind all of us to select pastries. I addressed her and inquired if we could go ahead and she dismissed us that someone would be right with us. I interposed and asked to be told what the categorical difference was between them and those already in line. I asked if they had a different point of origination in the line or if there was some other significant criteria because if not I ask that we be served in order. At this point she told me to hurry up and pick something out since,"" I'm making a big deal about it"". I approached the counter and said I'm not making a big deal out of it and she interrupted me and said something along the lines of,"" are you going to tell me what you want or keep wasting everyone's time?"" I said since I'm wasting time let me just ask to see the manager. She replied she is the manager. I asked for her name. My sister asked if someone else can serve us and I simply walked away. Put simply, at the time I begin my transaction - I'm not wasting anyone's time because I waited fairly like everyone else. Disneyland doesn't rush people through rides faster because they wait in line longer. That would be absurd and bad for business. In fact, they find ways to make the wait more entertaining by putting beautiful flowers all around the guests and have themed characters visiting with children. Amelie's is the opposite of Disneyland. There is no magic there. There are so many other places in NoDa and Greater Charlotte that will treat me with respect. Rest assured, I'll never be back and I'll definitely be sharing this experience with those I care about. I can't imagine who would condone that type of communication in a manager and I hope no one else has to be subjected to that disdain and scorn.",1,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

However I do like the idea and the location and it's nice to have a bakery in town like this. First thing to know though is the staff is generally rude and if you have questions - lord help you because they'll either act like you're dumb or act like their life is ruined by you asking anything. Second thing to know : DO NOT ORDER COFFEE. Just don't - it tastes sour .. somehow. Just go somewhere else.. Third: do not get bakery items such as cakes or muffins- will 100% always be dry I recommend the lemon bar or bread pudding when it's available. The ambiance is really cute but I think that's what draws people. They also sell fun little things like notebooks, stickers and even kitchen supplies which are great for gifts. Their website is also user friendly right now due to Covid, but remember you cannot go in and browse. Overall it was exactly as expected.

The milk bar pie aka crack pie was highly recommended so we dropped in after having lunch at Wicked Spoon to pick up a couple of slices. The pie was dense and the taste just didn't blow me away.

I purchased the Crack Pie MilkQuake since it's only made in Vegas Asked for suggestions beforehand, the girl at the counter wasn't too interested in helping me out in choosing something.

The ice cream is creamy and yummy and their scoops are huge. The strawberry was creamy with plenty of strawberry in it. The milk n cookies had semi baked chocolate chip cookie throughout and was amazing.

"While I do enjoy stopping by here to collect the free piece of chocolate you receive upon entering the store, I was never interested in trying any of their sundaes. I know they don't make their own ice cream and their choice of using Dreyer's isn't particularly enticing to me. However, hubby and I were spending any evening on the Strip, we were craving ice cream and we were far too lazy to walk to where we really wanted to go. So we made it work. We looked over the menu and decided to share their large Brownie Sundae - but instead of vanilla ice cream, we chose cherry. We requested no caramel and asked that they use their dark chocolate hot fudge. Wow. So good! The ice cream does have a very smooth texture (just the way I like it). And it isn't overly sweet or flavorful, which paired perfectly with the crazy-richness of the dark chocolate hot fudge. But what made this Sundae extra amazing was the Brownie. It had the perfect balance of being moist and fluffy. It also had a amazingly strong chocolate flavor. Mmmm! I can't wait to go back!

The soft serve was creamy and tasted exactly as described but wasn't overly sweet. But, the added cornflake crunch was not what I'd expected. It had a saltiness to it that didn't really mesh well with the soft serve. We ended up scraping it off. Now, the crack pie. Ohhhhh, the crack pie. I'm obsessed with it. It reminds me of a pecan pie, without the pecans, but more dense. It was rich but not heavy. You could taste the butter in every bite. My only regret was not getting another slice for the ride home.

"Quite possibly my most favoritest place in Vegas. I found it on my last trip in March of 2009 and tasted the best cheese danish I have ever had in my life. Flaky pastry...delicious (not too sweet sweet) cheese...in perfect ratio. This weekend, I revisited only to be completely impressed with the chocolate tart. Super chocolately without being overwhelming and the tart was the perfect texture, not too thick or chewy with just the right amount of crispness. It was so good, I brought one back home for my hubby and he loved it. I will say though, that I did try the huge red velvet cupcake once and that was not perfect. It was a little dry on the inside. While I wouldn't call the prices affordable, they are low by Vegas standards and in line with prices for such things in San Francisco. I won't be going back to Vegas anytime soon, but in the meantime, I'll just dream about this place until Thomas Keller one day realizes that the residents of SF would probably swarm this place.",5,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

And for those of you who don't know what I'm talking about, go Google the creme brÃ»lÃ©e donut now and watch a video of it in action. It's just one those things where words won't do it justice. The thing about Donut Bar is that it is open until the store runs out of donuts. Therefore, I recommend getting there when it opens or going on a weekday. My friends and I got there on a Tuesday morning around 10am, and there wasn't a line. The best part was that there was a ton of creme brÃ»lÃ©e donuts available! We tried the pistachio lemon, maple bacon, strawberries & cream, and the creme brÃ»lÃ©e donuts. Out of everything I tried, the creme brÃ»lÃ©e is my favorite. The sugar coating is thick and tough, making it impossible to 'crack' with a plastic spoon. The cream filling inside is not too sweet and delicious. The other donuts are the cake kind, which is not my favorite.

I love their pretzel cone ice cream The lightly salted pretzel cone is a nice compliment to their sweet ice cream. My favorite ice cream with the pretzel cone was the chai tea (I normally do not like too sweet dessert. I found the chai tea ice cream to be a perfect balance of sweetness, but my friends love their butter pecan, vietnamese coffee and the mint chocolate.

"I drove up the street chasing my sweet tooth and glad this is where it brought me. I mean holy baked goodness this place has arguably the best cake in Pittsburgh. Rich, sweet, layered, tasty and real. Sweet baby Jesus, just thinking about it makes me sad I left a bite on the plate. DONT YOU JUDGE ME. Just kidding judge away, after a hefty meal, this slice is a sharer. Taking on a slice on your own is only if you have the room after dinner or whatever. Running you around $7 for a slice, these cakes are clearly made the old-fashion way and with real ingredients- No preservatives, no bullshit. They have vegan options, which offends me because that's food discrimination, but I got over it shortly after my taste-buds simultaneously cried little tears of joy in my mouth. I tasted 3 different cakes but the one I devoured was the Pistachio, creme something something. I forgot the name because I blacked out from a flavor coma. WORTH EVERY PENNY. The place also has plenty of coffee options cold-press, espresso,lattes, mochas etc etc etc. (I had a cold press which was perfect bitter counter to the sweet cake.)The environment is cool but no way of browsing a menu for what you want to drink and if you ask the lady behind the counter she will be smart and snippy with you.

There isn't much difference in quality or service but the wait at this location is significantly less. While they have both soft serve and taiyaki (fish shaped waffle), I think their taiyaki is better than their soft serve. Their soft serve is good but a lot of the flavors are really subtle. They rotate their flavors though so at least there is always something new to try if that is your thing. I love their taiyakis. You can get them filled with nutella, custard, cookies and cream, taro, cheese, or red bean. My favorite is the custard and they are absolutely delicious when eaten fresh.

"We came here because one of our friends raved about the breads and cakes here. When we arrived early Sunday, we were excited because there was no line snaking outside like there was previously. We picked our breads and ordered our drink and 3 cake slices at the kiosk so the order would be ready by the time we got to the register. Their system of ringing up purchases is horrifically inefficient. The cashiers individually wrap up each item in plastic prior to boxing it. When I asked the cashier why they didn't just package it before it was placed on the display shelves, she stated that it was because there was nobody whose specific job it was prepackage the pastries and that it was only done when it wasn't busy. Wouldn't it be better to package the items beforehand so it's easier on the cashiers, faster for the customers, and ensure that there's no contamination of the breads/pastries that are sitting on the shelves?? Additionally, I think the workers need to be re-educated regarding safe food handling practices. They handle food to package it, but in addition, they handle money, cards, etc., then they go and touch their faces, lips, and I watched one gloved worker place an order in a box, then use said gloved hand to rub her nose. I would recommend ordering any drinks and cakes at the kiosk so that it will be ready by the time you get to the register, but make sure you check your order before you leave. We left without checking because our kids were getting antsy after waiting in the line and they forgot one of the 3 cake slices we ordered. Bad on us for not checking. One more tip: if you don't care to have your pastries packaged individually in plastic, just let the cashier know and save yourself some time and aggravation.",3,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

Since I had a party of four, I let an older lady go ahead of us in the line because it knew it would take them awhile to help her. I waited for what seemed like 10 mins. A gentleman in a bright colored shirt came in behind us. After the older lady ordered and went to pay, my children and I went up to the counter. Lady in a white shirt (all of the other workers were in red shirts) proceeded to look at us, then looked over my shoulder and asked the gentleman behind me if he had been helped. It took me by surprise at first, all she had to do was confirm with me that we were next in line. Since she felt like we skipped this guy, she went out of her way to apologize to him and thank him several times for his patience and even got another worker to stop what she was doing to help him first. WTH??? We were waiting long before he came in..... She totally rubbed me the wrong way and I will never visit this place again.

"Despite the mediocre reviews and people's disappointment over the hype of Milk Bar, I still have to praise their soft serve. People say smell and taste illicit the strongest of memories and that's probably why tasting cereal milk soft serve topped with cornflakes is so nostalgic for me. I realize it is probably one of the most overpriced soft serves in the country, but I will gladly pay $6 (+$1 cornflakes topping) for a piece of my childhood. The soft serve is thicker than typical and each spoonful literally reminds me of the bottom of a bowl of cornflakes. Outstanding. As for the other soft serves, I wasn't a big fan of the fruity [pebbles] soft serve or the crack pie version. For me, I like it pretty simple. They do offer samples for you to try should you want to taste before ordering. In terms of the cookies and pies, these definitely go into the overpriced and over hyped category. Years ago when I first tried their cookies at the original Milk Bar in NYC, the cookies were sold in display cases instead of being wrapped in cellophane. At that time, I thought the compost cookie was the best thing since sliced bread. Now, I think the cookies taste stale and mass produced. The crack pie is also no longer crack to me. It was so overtly sweet that I couldn't understand why I liked it before. However, that isn't to say I won't return for the soft serve.

I was most excited about a toasted marshmallow on top, but it tasted salty and wasn't gooey all the way through because it's only toasted with a blow torch. Neat trick but it didn't live up to my expectations. Also, the whole thing is tough to eat with the spoon they give.

The people behind me were paying in first and I was left for last. That immediately struck me as horrible customer service. But, it doesn't end there. When I got home I tried cutting the crumb cake, and it was stiff as a hockey puck. It just looked really old, and dry as I expected. Lastly, the lobster tail was soggy, mushy, and flavorless.

"HAD to pop in during my last trip to Vegas. HAAADDD to! My first time to Milk Bar and it was delightful! Came about an hour before close. The cashier/server was super nice and was also quick to suggest the Greatest Hits combo which comes with the Cereal Milk soft serve, a Compost Cookie, a 3 pack of the B'Day Cake Truffles and a slice of Milk Bar Pie. We also bought the Chocolate B'day Cake Truffles. I didn't know some of the baked goods came packaged but my, was everything fresh tasting. Made me ask, ""what is this sorcery??"" The Cereal Milk soft serve is topped with corn flakes. It was probably one of the best tasting soft serve ice cream I have ever had. It was creamy, deliciously sweet and the cereal added wonderful texture. I loved how there was cereal at the bottom of the cup too so the ratio of cereal and soft serve is consistent. Brought the rest of the stuff to the hotel room and tried a bite of everything before bed... The B'Day Cake Truffle is like the perfect bite of, well, birthday cake. Tastes a lot like cake batter married funfetti cake. There's a thin, crisp layer around an ooey-gooey cake-pop-like center. The Chocolate B'Day Truffle is equally delicious. It was a like a fudgy brownie bite. Super chocolatey and decadent! The Milk Bar Pie is just... it is a MUST try when you come to Milk Bar, hence the self title lol. The crust is thin and buttery. The filling kinda reminds me of a lemon bar without the lemon, if that makes sense. It tastes like caramel-like, brown sugary goodness! Yum! And last but not least, the Compost cookie. It's got espresso (?), chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, pretzels & potato chips. Such a great combo of sweet & salty. The coffee taste also shines through. The texture is freaking awesome, even a day after purchase. I think of all the treats I tried, the Cereal Milk soft serve and the Milk Bar Pie has my heart!

"Restaurant review This is a brief review of their coffee. I did come here one other time for dessert which was amazing however I recently got their bubble tea to go. Service is quick after they take your order. There is multiple drink options including bubble tea with Boba. I can't say that I'm a fan of this over Starbucks coffee. The other thing that makes me nervous is that the flavoring is likely a powder however I ended up with the traditional milk tea. It is rather sweet even sweeter than a latte. If milk tea is your thing then it's great to have this place is an option Pros: This cafÃ© has both desserts, coffee, and other Asian type desserts Cons: Slightly expensive compared to Starbucks Hidden deals: Please download the hooked app which has rotating savings and includes buy one get one free BOGO.

"I'm hooked on Campbell's popcorn! I've driven by this place several times and figured it was time for a visit since the peanut gallery (my co-food experts: my children) were in tow. There's a sign in the front advertising free samples so why the heck would we ever pass that up;) We tried several varieties of popcorn but went home with Cotton Candy, Caramel Apple, JalapeÃ±o Cheddar, and Garlic. The popcorn here is absolutely perfect! This beats movie theater popcorn by a 1000%. There's also a big variety or chocolate covered everything: pretzels, cookies, strawberries and jalapeÃ±os. They also have some pretty big cupcakes, caramel and candy apples. We did not indulge further because we did not want to spoil our lunch but will be going back to try all of their extra goodies:) If you're in the area pay them a visit, you won't be disappointed if you do:) Update: I visited Campbell's again today (1/20/14) and purchased half a dozen cupcakes. These were by far the worst cupcakes I've ever had. We were not able to eat them because they were too sweet. My kids took sips of milk in between bites but they were not able to finish them. If three young teenagers aren't able to eat them, then you know there's a problem. I'm still giving them five stars because their popcorn is worthy of this rating. To the management: please stick to the popcorn and leave the cupcakes alone.",5,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive
"Pretty letdown at what ""looked"" to be an exciting new place. I saw this being constructed a few months ago, and wanted to give it a try. Place is very very small, and full of the drunken guests taking up the line asking for a million samples. Meanwhile 4 other employees just stood around doing nothing really, where they could've helped me. I got a sample of the fruity cereal, and it was pretty gross, obviously full of artificial flavoring and just left a bad after taste. Finally ordered a strawberry ""Quake"" shake, and a cookie. The shake was a major letdown, and flat of flavor. Couldn't eat more than 2 bites and threw away. The cookie was even worse, just garbage: NO flavor whatsoever. That was thrown away as well. Giving them 1 star for the marketing, as the signs & promotional items got me really interested. Unfortunately I just don't thing they serve a good product. I also liked them open late, but besides that, I'll clearly never return.",2,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown

Visiting my sister out of state and reading so many great reviews about this place I was SO excited to grab some goodies with my sisters and niece. However while waiting in line from afar my sister was aggressively shouted out about the mask she was wearing. She was wearing a face shield from her nose below. Had she known she was wearing a face covering that wasn't up to standard she would have immediately corrected the issue. Instead she willingly stepped outside while I continued to order. At that time I let the cashier know how rude and inappropriate her approach was and had we known from the beginning it wouldn't have been a problem. She then let me know employees had been tested positive and they had to be shut down. That's no excuse for poor customer service. Once leaving the cafe we called to get her name which is Terry and she hung up the phone several times once asking to speak with the manager. Hopefully the food tastes better than the employees attitude.,1,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

Came here based on its famous roots. We first came about 7pm and the line was long with very long thinking customers so it was much better when we returned at 11pm. The set up is bad for this. You cannot view their goods in the case prior to purchasing because people are standing in front of it. It would be better if you can view separately from line purchase. Everything is highly priced as expected. A small single serving strawberry cheese cake is $10.95. Cookies are sold by the pound. I wanted something out of the ordinary so I got the Lobster Tail $5.95 and Mini Eclair $2.95. They were both really good but not enough to make me dream about it the next day. I am also not a dessert person so maybe I am a little biased that way. Great to try as a treat but not worth going out of your way or standing in mega line for.,3,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown

They have a range of flavors like Chocolate, Vanilla, Pistachio, and Raspberry (I like the Pistachio one the best) They also have seasonal flavors like Cherry Chocolate, lemon and strawberry (the strawberry one this case was bomb). The price for one is ok. I ordered an Iced Latte once which was good, but its really strong coffee so if you like Dunkin Donuts it's a complete reversal. For this review, I am referring to the Bouchon inside the Venetian Casino, not the one near Las Vegas Blvd. There's actually two. Another good thing about this establishment is that since it's located at the Venetian you get free parking on the Strip!

"Very sad experience with the lady who worked the Saturday evening shift tonight at 6:00pm. I ordered from Grubhub as always, and when they were short an ice cream, I called the store. The lady first tried to pass it off as if I had never ordered it and proceeded to read me my order out loud curiously absent the cookies and cream scoop of ice cream I had ordered. When I politely informed her that I was looking at my receipt from Grubhub and would be more than happy to send her a screenshot as proof that I had not only ordered it but had paid for it, she told me she could not see her screen and was waiting for it to load. Finally she admitted to the mistake and offered nothing to help. She suggested I call Grubhub and deal with it, but I explained that the ice cream was for my daughter and that we just needed the ice cream. She proceeded to completely b*%#h me out, saying to me in a condescending tone, ""what do you expect? For me to drive it over to you?"" And I said, ""actually yes, that would be nice, considering I am a loyal customer of yours, the omission is your mistake, and I live just down the street."" She then responded that she would not be able to help me further and she offered to take my number and have the manager call me to work it out. I'd say that's the one responsible thing she did. But overall, she proceeded to talk to me as if it was my problem that she made a mistake. I was so disappointed by her attitude and refusal to think outside of the box and try to make her customers happy when it was admittedly her mistake. I hope the owner reads this because my friends and I have been major patrons of your ice cream store and will now be taking our ice cream orders elsewhere because of one rude employee. Please teach your employees basic skills in human decency and when they make mistakes, please teach them to try and rectify it. This is the last time I ever order from you guys.

Sure, it doesn't compromise the flavor, but it does show it's not the best made ice cream in town. Also, I don't really get the novelty of the ice cream coming in Chinese take-out boxes, but some people really get a kick out of it. Lastly, street parking can be rough to find some nights (but hey, it is downtown Phoenix so what do you expect).

However, because I'm lactose intolerant and didn't bring any lactaid with me when I went, I have to give a review on the cookies only. First, the staff work as quickly as possible, but since they're basically a stand next to Momofuku in the Cosmopolitan, people can be rude and cut right in front of you! (Which they do!) Only so much the staff can do about these people lol. They're all really nice people though! (As are most servers in Vegas) I got three cookies, which is one of the deals. Cookies are $3 each or 3/$8. Blueberry and cream, compost cookie, and the chocolate chocolate cookie. All of these cookies were a bit dry and not really that great or even memorable. The blueberry and cream tasted like it had sour cream in it. It was weird and I wasn't too much of a fan, that I didn't even finish it. The compost cookie wasn't *bad* but it wasn't that great either. It was a little salty, a little sweet, and pretty much forgetabble. Also crumbly and did I mention dry? Finally, the chocolate chocolate, which lives up to its name. It's super rich and pretty satisfying, but again, nothing special. So for cookies, I think because they're prepackaged and not freshly made, I would just skip it.

"Samples: Banana Cream Pie, Birthday Cake, Butter Pecan, Salty Caramel Truffle, Midnight Madness Oree-Dough and Graham Central Station Blondie Sundae with Buckeye and Peanut Butter Parfait, Caramel, Whipped Cream, Cherry An Ohio native of the Northwest who spent his formative years with Toft's, Friendly's, Breyer's or Soft-Serve before developing a taste for the finer things at Jeni's in Columbus, it really does not seem all that strange that it took 36 years to visit Youngstown-based Handel's Homemade Ice Cream & Yogurt but on Saturday the omission was finally righted, a trip to the Las Vegas Scoop Shop on the corner of Hualapai and Tropicana actually more impressive than one may of thought. Born in 1945, techniques changed but formulas still using an old-school base with all flavors churned on site, Handel's Las Vegas occupies a somewhat out-of-the-way corner in the western Suburbs and with nothing but tableless benches offered as seating the layout is decidedly grab-and-go only, a few patrons wavering over nearly thirty options while others opted to do some tasting. Featuring four windows, though the midday only saw two open as a duo of young ladies provided smiles with the scoops, tastes of Butter Pecan and ""Salty Caramel Truffle"" reminded me of slow-spun flavors from my childhood, the Banana Cream Pie and Birthday cake trending a bit more over-sweet and artificial while a seasonal special titled ""Midnight Madness"" delivered all sorts of richness with Dark Chocolate Punched up by Oreos and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. Affordable and sizably portioned compared to others, two scoops approximating a pint for just $4.25, it was on the cashier's advice that Graham Central Station was paired to Chocolate-Chip Cookie Dough with a mix-in from Nabisco, the former a lot like eating soggy S'mores while the later was exactly as might be expected, the texture intriguing but overwhelming sweetness difficult to ignore. Always a sucker for a Sundae, not to mention housemade baked goods, part two of the tasting entailed a warm blondie at the base of a plastic clamshell and although whipped cream and caramel were both no better than store-bought the pairing of Peanut Butter Parfait and a treat from my Home State were as delicious as they were nostalgic, the blend reminding me a lot of Moose-Tracks - a flavor so difficult to track down in my childhood that a three hour trip to Youngstown may not have been all that bad. THREE STARS: Noteworthy for its old school appeal, though nouveau Artisans have long left their flavors and smoothness far behind, Handel's is well served in its suburban strip-mall location, no doubt a step-up from the Midwest to Sin City while still maintaining its nostalgia but by no means 'destination worthy' stuff.",3,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive

"My favorite pastry here is the milk pudding buns. I didn't see any around when I first looked around and ended up with other items. I asked the worker putting the items out if they had any and she said not today. I finish paying and while waiting for my drink decided to walk around once more and guess what! MILK PUDDING BUNS!! I was upset at first, but quickly grabbed 6 buns and headed over to check out again. The guy at the cashier noticed I had an 85C bag in my hand already and welcomed me back while he was ringing up the people in front of me. The store smelled quite off today, not fresh baked goods, but smelled like sewer today. I can smell it through my 3 layer cotton mask . Hopefully they get that fixed and due to covid they removed the tongs. I rather they offer tongs cuz there were multiple people touching pastries and putting them back. Hand sanitizer is only available checkout where you pick up drinks. I think having one available as people enter the store would be a great idea. As for the worker who I asked if they had any milk buns, she asked what kind and named a long list of buns until I recognized a name just to tell me they didn't have any. Which was inaccurate, at least check before answering me if you're unsure but she answered back with a quick solid No. Shoutout to the Gambit, the cashier today you attention to detail actual made up for the somewhat poor experience I had earlier.",4,Positive,Negative,Negative,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Was so excited to eat one of Buddy's cannoli's. it was nothing special. The cannoli left a funny coating in your mouth, maybe the grease from the deep fryer? I tried a chocolate meringue OMG it was so hard at 8:20 in the morning nearly broke a tooth, no joke.. The cupcakes red velvet, and the flower one was no big deal.. The Cupcakery and Give Me Sugar make better ones..I did like the pecan wedge dipped in chocolate, it was very good and the apple turn over. The Cannoli' tower was expensive and had NO flavor. Spent 36.00 for blah pastries. I am a local, I spread the word on good food. I was an avid diner of Max Brenner's dining there once a week, because it was good and unique. I took everyone I knew who came to town there. Sadly ceaser's did not renew their lease, so they closed. Thought Carlos would take it's place, but it won't. My husband wants to buy our 30 wedding anniv. cake their but I am not sure?? Maybe he should have brought the staff from Carlos to Vegas for training?? The staff also was very disorganized, calling our number 5 times, each time I told them I had been helped, They were not busy Monday morning at 8:20 a.m also did not have Lobster tails, that is what I went there for... Cannoli and Lobster tails... I love Cake Boss, and all the shows Buddy, but Carlos bakery was a Huge disappointment. Won't be back sorry.. I am a local, and am always trying new places, and when it's good everyone will hear about it.. This was not...

If you're in the mood for the regular old lineup, this isn't your spot. It's just so creative. 2) They truly have something for everyone. Gluten Free? Done. Dairy Free? Done.

"So this review was a little tough for me to right. I am a HUGE dessert fan and love trying all sorts of different things. I was SO excited to go to Carlo's bake shop and felt that when I actually ate my dessert I was let down. It was no where near as good as I was hoping - especially after I waited 30 minutes to order. First thing - there is almost ALWAYS a long line. I have waited in this line twice for desserts and both times I felt that the line was not worth the wait. The second thing is the price. Don't get me wrong, I know you're in Vegas on the strip in a pricey casino. All of these things mean that items will be slightly (hehe) more expensive than usual. I feel that Carlo's marks up even higher than that - I mean seriously some of their desserts are just too much for what you get. The actual desserts - meh - nothing special. I would think with that with the hype and celebrity chef linked to it the desserts would be out of this world, absolutely divine, die and go to heaven type deal. They just weren't. Maybe this was my fault because I had high expectations but I know going forward when I visit my sister in Vegas this won't be high on my list of priorities.",3,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown

The fact that the soft serve tastes as good as it did when I was a kid (if not better) is obviously the main attraction. They always have so many fun flavors and all kinds of different ice cream treats from the classics to the modern and even things you can't get anywhere else.

"This place is a must go to if you a donut lover and in Las Vegas. Plentiful parking in the area makes it easy to pop in and pickup these treats. The building itself is a cool little place. Upon walking in you are immediately greeted and welcomed. The person helping me was able to explain each and every donut and asked me what preferences I had and suggested items to try. The selection was great on the morning that I arrived. I chose the Creme BrÃ»lÃ©e donut and a lemon cheesecake donut with a milk to go. The donuts are pricey, until you bite into them and realize the quality ingredients that they are made with. I was a few miles away before I tried my selections and immediately wished that I had purchased more. Great selection, priced right for the quality, and a friendly helpful staff.

"First and foremost, the staff was very friendly and accommodating at Milk Bar. Overall the store has cool and colorful decor with a modern appeal. I expected to pay more than the usual since this place is on the strip and located in a very popular resort and casino. I decided on getting the, Greatest Combo. Which was a good idea since it was my first time and wanted to try a bit of everything. The combo included a slice of crack pie, cookie, birthday cake truffles (3 pieces) and soft serve ice cream cone w/cornflake pieces. Crack Pie- Clever name, was ok and it was a bit bland in flavor. Cookie- This was my favorite of the items, consistent, chewy and full of flavor. I got the compost cookie. Will have to go back and try the other flavors of cookies Birthday Cake Truffles- Looks pretty but overall it was good and a little on the sweeter side. Soft Serve- I was expecting more of a creamy and tasty flavor but it more of like, ""I could've gone to DQ, reaction."" I wouldn't waste my time just to grab something sweet in the future. However, if I'm ever in the area with family and friends visiting is probably the only time I would come back or if I'm at one of the many restaurants or events at Cosmo. FYI: This place has no tables or chairs, it's more of a grab and go. There is lounge area that is part of the popular chandelier bar across the way that has decent amount of sofas and side tables. 2017 Yelp Review #10",3,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"I loooovvee this place. I'm so glad they finally made it to Las Vegas! The team is still trying to figure out their groove so the lines are a little long but they have the same long lines in California, too so I'm used to it. They do have a quick check out station at the entrance, so maybe use that. My favourites are the egg custard, taro marble, fruit tart, and the berry tales. Honestly, anything you choose here is going to be scrumptious. If you need a jolt to wake up, I highly recommend the sea salt Carmel coffee.

"Let's be honest-- I love sprinkles. I used to get their cupcakes every time we would go to SoCal, and was so happy that they decided to open up a location here in Vegas. We've been to their location at the linq quite a couple of times, but yesterday's visit was just disappointing. I dragged a couple of friends with me to satisfy my cupcake craving, but what I got instead were two very dry and crumbly cupcakes. I got the seasonal chocolate chip cookie cupcake and my favorite, the dark chocolate cupcake. As soon as I bit into the chocolate chip cookie one, the whole cake practically crumbled in my hand. I had to use a fork just so I wouldn't make a mess. Whatever, I thought it was just that cupcake, but when I came home to eat the dark chocolate cupcake the same thing happened. The cake fell apart, and broke off into tiny little pieces. I mean, the flavors were still there, frosting was still great, but it was just not enjoyable to eat. It just didn't feel nor did it taste fresh. I know I'll be back anyway since, as I've mentioned, I love sprinkles, but hopefully next time will be a better experience.",3,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"First time here and here's my first impression. The space is pretty big if you're wanting to hangout here or eat your bakery stuffs.. they have a wide selection of breads that it looks big and puffy but as soon as u bite into the bread it deflates.. so I'm thinking they just used a lot yeast to make it rise (I don't know. I don't bake) and the stuffing inside is not a lot either. They have cookies and pan bread... it's not that good either... they have teas and coffee to go with their bakery goods . So it's ok but I would suggest to just get your tea to the store next door called share tea. It's pretty good there... so the most disappointing part here is the waiting and the cleanliness part... when u get their bakery stuffs you have to get a tray and put ur own breads etc, they provide you with your own tongs. The price and the name of the bread are displayed! While holding the breads, bakery goods on ur tray you go to this long line to wait and pay while having your food exposed to cough, sneeze, air etc..there is no protection because they don't put plastic wraps until You get to the register where the money and all kinds of germs your food can get exposed to.. thee waiting in line to pay takes about 45 mins so if you're carrying your big tray with your goods depending on how heavy it could be it's really annoying... so when you get to the register the cashiers have to no conversation because they looked pretty beat up, taking payments, bagging the goods one by one and arranging them In a box. It's not very efficient.. and they are tired.the cashier I had said she hates it.. lol! I understand that they make their breads, goodies fresh but packing them already before putting them in the shelves is much more safer, cleaner and efficient if people loves their baked good they will buy them anyways, I'm sure they still make it fresh everyday because it will run out, some of the baked goods are gone and I can see them refilling them... so to save time, to save the food from Dirt packed them, and provide the clients a box so they can get in and get out.... and they also have to make sure the breads are filled and not just air inside... if it's gets better I might give it another chance but if not...

After being told yes, I purchased three trays, and several boxes to Bri g home. Big big mistake. Cookies were stale and broken into pieces. What a huge waste of time, money, and effort. They used to sell individual butter cookies and cookies in little boxes which were delicious. I should have known by the lack of customers, and no lines at all.

The cupcakes were all very basic. Plain cupcake flavors with plain cupcake icings . I was hoping for some elaborate flavors, filled cupcakes with amazing decorations. I got a coconut cupcake because in Indiana, where I live, I get a coconut cupcake at my favorite place. This one was small, a plain white cupcake flavor with some coconut flavoring in the icing. I think I'm spoiled by The Flying Cupcake in Indiana which provides me a giant sized cupcake made of coconut angel food cake, filled with coconut cream, and topped with buttercream and coconut flakes.

If you like sweet and salty at the same time, then Jeni's is just for you. Salty caramel, salted peanut and chocolate are always on the menu.

Vanilla Macaron: these were HUGE, size of my palm. I was excited, then I bit into it... hard as a rock. Was very disappointed..I paid 3.50 for a macaron I expect it to be at least half decent.

"Crazy busy! The ""take-a-number"" system seemed to create chaos and confusion with both the employees and the customers. In a busy and noisy bakery, it can be hard to hear them call out the numbers as they flip the counter. And the employees often seemed to not know how many numbers had been pulled and would guess how far to advance the counter. Beyond the little snags with running out of tickets in the machine the confusion at the counter, Presti's is a great bakery. The cannolis are out of this world and rival the ones I had in NYC. The cannoli shell was crisp and the filling was smooth and creamy with mini chocolate chips. On the other hand, the hot apple cider wasn't nearly hot enough and lacked the fullness that I expect from spiced beverages: nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, allspice.",4,Positive,unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown
"Don't forget to try their Bacon Brittle, which I completely spaced out on! I had Sweet Republic on the top of my ""must eat"" list while in Arizona since I saw them on Bon Appetit's 10 best ice cream shops list. Although they are located in Scottsdale, they are 10-15 minutes north of Scottsdale Stadium (where the SF Giants play). We drove up for ice cream after a Saturday afternoon game, and the shop was fairly empty around 4pm. That was great since we had time to look at all the different flavors for their sorbets and ice creams, and also sample a couple before having to make a decision (the Maple Pecan flavor I tried was pretty good). We finally settled on a scoop of Salted Butter Caramel (Soft Buttery Caramel Ribbons in Creamy Vanilla w/a Sprinkle of Salt) & Almond Buttercrunch (<a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sweet-republic-scottsdale-2?select=yz2rj3V6U4KXcpnPnYS-cw#yz2rj3V6U4KXcpnPnYS-cw"">yelp.com/biz_photos/swee¦</a>). I thought I liked the salted butter caramel more, but the almond buttercrunch really grew on me the more I ate it, especially when I got a bite with the buttercrunch. The salted caramel at Bi-Rite Creamery in San Francisco still wins the salted caramel battle in my book, but I still enjoyed the ice cream at Sweet Republic a lot. I didn't have a chance to compare their ice cream to Churn, but hope to have a chance to do so in the future! Parking is ample, and the staff is really nice.

This place is WAYY too busy and the ice cream isn't worth the wait. There was a long line inside on a colder night in phoenix and the staff made everyone move outside and wait in the cold.

"My wife is a fan of the show so we stopped by while visiting family in Vegas. While in line we asked the employee monitoring the line if lobster tails were still available because it was late and near closing. She went to check and told us that they would make some for us! Fantastic! When we made it the counter, we ordered two tails and the worker told us she would check. She asked another employee who rolled her eyes and said, ""Just tell them we are out."" She did and I explained what the other employee had said and so she went to check in the back. She came back with two tails! I forgave the bad attitude because it was late at night and I understand that the workers wanting to go home. However, the other part of our order was filled incorrectly which we did not discover until we got home. The store was closed by then so there was no way to remedy the error. The items were good, but not what we wanted. A few days later we stopped by on our way out of town and got some treats. An hour later on the interstate we opened the boxes to discover that one item had been left out of our order. It was a cookie that my seven year old wanted. (Because of the show, he wants to be a baker when he grows up.) After arriving home I called and asked for a refund for the cookie we did not receive. I was told that they could not do that and instead they offered to replace it. Great, except that I was in Boise, Idaho and could not driving back to Vegas for a cookie. I explained this and was told, ""If you don't want it, that's your choice"" and they hung up. Because of the way I was treated in person and on the phone I will not go back and I recommend that you avoid this place as well. I would give zero stars if it were possible. While the lobster tail was delicious, the other things were just okay. Poor employee attitude and lackluster customer service have killed many businesses. Unless Carlo's fixes these, this location is doomed to fail as soon as the novelty of visiting a bakery seen on TV wears off. Shame on you Buddy for allowing this to happen at your family's store.",1,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"I have eaten here three times and they never disappoint. Staff are friendly and make an effort to talk and get your order correct. Ghirardelli chocolate is my favorite, so I am some biased, but the ice cream, chocolate chip cookies and candy selection are out of this world. The first time I go, was sundae with Ghirardelli fudge and two kinds of ice cream. Of course I also bought a bag of assorted Ghirardelli squares to go. The second time I tried the large chocolate chip cookie. It was warm and filled with huge chocolate chips, tasting as freshly baked. Third time was waffle bowl sundae, with hot fudge and of course waffle bowl is fudge dipped as well. Had to have another one of those cookies too. This sundae was so big I nearly didn't finish all, but was worth every bite. My favorite part is how they give a free promotional flavor chocolate square at the door.

I would have gotten more, but they had ran out of a lot of stuff! They even only had one chocolate macaron left, so getting there earlier is a must. Regardless, the macarons seem pricey, but they're about as big as my palm, so it's well worth it. They have pretty tasty macarons, but I wouldn't go as far as to say they're the best you can find -- maybe for Vegas though. I was considering giving this place four stars, but I couldn't really justify it.

It was late at night but I stopped in anyway to see what they had left. Thankfully, they had my favorite two flavors. My go to is always the red velvet cupcake but the pumpkin gives it a run for its money. The red velvet is perfect, one of the best versions of this flavor that I've tasted. And the pumpkin? It has just the right amount of cinnamon, spice, and pumpkin flavor. Sprinkles has nearly mastered the cupcake and their consistency across stores around the country is impressive. Each time I bite into one I'm amazed by how fresh, moist, and soft it is. The only two things I don't love are the icing, which is a little thick for my liking, and the prices...of course.",4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

The friendly staffer behind the counter was happy to oblige but warned me I might regret my earlier choices. He was right, so good! Rich smoky butter with salty pretzel chunks mixed in, awesome comfort food in a frozen package. So I ended up with a third scoop, poor me. Then I met the owners who are super nice and shared their back story, all around great experience and I'm glad I stopped by.

I cannot comment on the food because we did not get any. I was excited to go to Carlos Bakery (since I watch the show) but first let me start by saying it was nearly impossible and a pain to find. Then when you do find the place it is jam packed with people that you cannot even see the displays to decide what (if anything) you want to order. There were way too many people and it was chaos.

Our interaction was painless since I kinda knew what I wanted already. There's no place to sit inside to enjoy your ice cream. It's basically an enclosed ice cream stand. There's a couple park benches you can sit at but other than that you eat in your car or take it home. Over by Tropical Smoothie Cafe there's a lot of picnic tables if you wanna walk over there. We were there on Tuesday for the $2 deal but opted to get the 4 scoops sampler for $4. We got coconut, Oreos, strawberry cheesecake & graham central station. They were all good. I a sucker for coconut, however, the coconut one was my least favorite. Oreo & graham central station were delicious. They're not the best ice cream I've ever had but it was good & reasonably priced.

Delicious & healthy- not an impossible combo! Dairy based and vegan based ice creams with no artificial ingredients.

You could immediately taste the cannola oil they use instead of butter, and the cake itself too is dry and old, it'seven worse than the prepacked or vending machine type. So I gave another try to take a bite from one of their cannoli. Another disappointment! I wonder if Carlos' pastry chef is managing quality control or they are just catering their products to the regular mass without considering the authenticity of the real Italian Cannoli.

"I've been to Jeni's twice now and they have delicious ice cream. The reason for the low stars is because both times I have visited, the staff have made me feel like I have inconvenienced them by being there. It's incredibly awkward. My first visit I was ""greeted"" with a frown and eye roll. I didn't even want to ask for a sample because it was that awkward. My second visit was just the same. I took my sister there and she even made a comment on the service. We ordered the trio and went to sit outside. I soon realized we were given a wrong flavor but did not want to go back into the store and deal with the staff and neither did she. I am wary to go back because of my unpleasant experience both times.",2,Positive,Negative,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"I was excited to have found this place when I went to Vegas for EDC weekend. I was actually looking for a churro place but I guess this place popped up for their cone dipped in cinnamon sugar. Even more excited that the shuttle got lost and dropped us around the corner from Donut Bar!! So why 3 stars? Let me break it down: Ambience: 5/5. No complaints. Not the strip, and not a glamorous neighborhood, but inside is cute, the donuts all look amazing. Clean, etc. The board and menu is cute as well. Service: 5/5. The girl who helped us out was patient. It was kind of hard being a short Asian to try to see the donuts displayed in the back and not in the counter. She was super friendly, cheery, and overall nice. Service was quick. Layout: Definitely up with the social media trends with the hashtags and the sign so you can instagram those ginormous and beautiful looking donuts. But the most important part is the donut itself..... Donut/Pastries: 2.5/5. The donuts LOOK amazing. So much variety. Different sizes. Awesome flavor combinations. I bought 6 donuts. A whole box for $16. BUT the donut itself was so disappointing. The batter was dry and thick. Closer to an old-fashioned when it wasnt supposed to be. We got there right when they opened at 8am so its not stale. Its just the batter itself. All the donuts had the same batter so even if the frosting was different, the dry batter was still the same. Creme brulee donut was one of the top ones according to yelp and the girl, but even though the filling (amount was also inconsistent since I bought two), it still didnt moisten the dry batter. However, the crunch of breaking it was satisfying. The maple cinnamon which I figured was the closest to a churro was burnt near the top and edges but gooey in the middle. However it was too sweet. Perhaps it was the maple. I still ate 90%. I really wanted to like this place but their actual donuts were all disappointing. Could not use the #bestdonutsintheworld. Sorry! P.s. Apparently, the cone only is available after 10am. So I never even got what I came for. The rating is purely on the 3.5 stars rounded down to 3 as I do not think its overhyped for the donut itself. Everything was good though. Come for the novelty and not for the best donut in your life.",3,Negative,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown
"I don't get the hype over this place. Maybe the flagship store is better? We went twice in one week, hoping that maybe we just didn't get the right thing, but the experience wasn't great each time. The birthday cake is a big piece (recommend sharing), pretty tasty, but it's definitely not fresh. Cold, crunchy, and a little dry. $14 for a slice of cake and it's just famous because of the branding - its not actually good. We tried the cereal milk soft serve with rainbow sprinkles and even that was sour and salty - not very good. 2 stars because they have an amazing brand and excellent cold brew. The coffee is the only good thing. Even the service was bad.",2,Negative,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"As someone with mild celiac disease, there wasn't much I could get here. In fact, there was but only one sweet I could take to: their red velvet gluten free cupcake, conveniently stamped with a red, bold capital ""G"" to draw distinction between its wheat laden counterpart, as all of their cupcakes and cookies contain wheat gluten, alike. At $3.75, it wasn't the pricing that marred me, but rather the quantity of tablespoons of sugar in the frosting.

"Alright, Amelie's has clearly built a reputation. The Uptown location along with the NoDa location both have some fun and creative seating. The coffee and tea options are probably the best offerings. I feel like most of their pastries are just mass produced, over-priced, lower than expected quality. It is a fun touristy experience, but not a place I would go regularly for a delicious treat. I have visited the NoDa location a couple of times in April and May, I've tried a few of the macaroons (and honestly, I just don't like macaroons so no fault to Amelie's on this one), the salted caramel brownie was gritty from the sugar not breaking down, and the brioche a tet with espresso & chocolate was unimpressive.

"I had a lavender and honey ice cream donut sandwich and it was absolutely amazing. First off the ice cream is delicious. Rich and creamy without any cloying sweetness to it. Just the right amount of lavender so it takes like a flower (but not a cleaning product). Now you're thinking that ice cream on a donut will be too much, too heavy. You're wrong. The donut is perfection. Warm with a subtle glaze. A crunch to the exterior but OH SO FLUFFY on the interior. The combination is absolutely to die for.

"You know what you need to get? A frekkin' cannoli!!!!!! My husband and I decided try a handful of items and we both agreed that the cannoli was bombastical. Everything else was just alright. We stopped by after our dinner at Giada's so there was no line. Despite it being the end of the night, they still had a wide selection of stuff to choose from. We ordered: Strawberry shortcake- it looked so pretty and mouth watering, so I had to order it. The strawberries were sweet, the cream just right. The cake part was spongy, not a biscuit like pastry. Chocolate biscotti- pretty standard and not mind blowing. We decided to pick one because there was a variety of flavors. Figured they might be a special thing. Raspberry cookie- shortbread double cookie with raspberry jam in the middle. It was okay Chocolate cream puff- this was suggested by a patron in line. Very creamy, decadent, pretty. Taste was good. I dunno if it would be my go to item though. I will repeat this... Holy cannoli. They have two different sizes. I choose the mini and wish I had ordered the full size version. If I come back, that's what I would order, hands down!

"Espresso macaroon was FANTASTIC. Ooey gooey espresso cream filling with a chewy light glazed meringue outside. Oustanding, 5 stars based on the macaroon. If I were to guess the best would be the espresso or the vanilla macaroon, the texture and sweetness of the filling would taste pretty off if it were raspberry or lemon, but it could just be my taste. Bread pudding was good but not as mind blowing. I don't know why I got it, I mean I knew it wasn't going to be hot or come with any liquor based sauce but I bit. I wouldn't say it was a mistake other than I should have just ordered more cookies and possibly a croissant. Raisins and apples, bread was adequately chewy and sweet but it was just missing some pizazz.

"A group of us stayed at the Venetian, so we had to try this bakery out. I had the Valrhona Chocolate Cupcake and it was so good! First of all,the cupcake was pretty big. It's like twice the size of a normal cupcake, but not as big as the Costco muffins. The best part? It cost only $3.50. What a deal! The actual cupcake was super moist and there was just a little frosting, not sure what it was, but after reading a couple of reviews, apparently it's marshmallow. It was just a light coating of it. To my surprise as I was getting towards the middle, there was the Valrhona chocolate mousse. What a pleasant surprise! I I wasn't expecting that, but I guess if I actually read the description that the bakery provided for their customers, I would have have expecting it, but all I say when I was looking in the bakery case was CUPCAKE! They didn't need to sell me with the mousse, even though it tasted better with it. Next time I come here, I will definitely get another cupcake, even if I'm not staying at the Venetian.

You would never find beauties like this in a grocery store or chain. They are big, but still light enough to enjoy your own, but I suggest being ready to share a bite if given that look.

We immediately went over to the ice cream. The man who was working was super friendly and when I mentioned yelp (considering when you check in there you get a free chocolate pretzel with your purchase) he told me to mention him by full name, so Nolan Anthony Sanders- thanks for being so helpful and overall awesome! Anyway, back to the sweets. I got a scoop of blackberry cheesecake ice cream on a sugar cone. My friend ordered the salted caramel pretzel ice cream with a sugar cone. With every lick of this ice cream I couldn't believe how amazing it was. Real blackberry purÃ©e, and creamy cheesecake ice cream-- oh my gosh. I want some right now. My friend loved her ice cream as well. I also got a cinnamon sugar white chocolate covered graham cracker- which was amazing as well. The chocolate was so creamy! For my free pretzel, I got a milk chocolate covered pretzel. It was good, but it didn't impress me too much. I like a thick coating of chocolate on mine and this one was quite thin. It wasn't bad though. I would love to try their awesome unique flavored chocolate covered pretzels! I then noticed they have Red Ribbon soda- locally made soda with out of this world flavors. I was so excited! The almond creme soda is amazing! (Thank you yelp for introducing me to the soda at the burgh bash!) I had to buy two bottles! I will return ASAP!

"*pre covid review* On an early morning after a flight to Vegas for a friends wedding, we discovered this donut place and decided we wanted to give it a try. We had seen reviews about how you have to show up early because they run out of donuts the further into the day they get. We headed over and were pleasantly surprised to find that there were only a handful of people in line already. When we got up to place our order we got a couple of donuts including the Creme brulee donut, Iced coffee a hot coffee. I thought the donuts were pretty good although I was torn with the crunchy sugar coating on top of the creme brulee donut. I guess that is subjective though.

It was like eating a puffy andes mint! Mint and chocolate was balanced perfectly. Had to special order these puppies though, because they were out of season. - Vanilla: simple and creamy - Pistachio: great taste and flavorful - Pumpkin: seasonal, but surprisingly GREAT!!! - Coffee: not bad Location: Located in Venetian Casino hotel, under and behind the escalators by the Grand Luxe Restaurant If price isn't a factor, then I would highly recommend!",4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

It was one of the best ice cream sundaes I have ever had. The ice cream was clearly home made and melted sweetly in your mouth. The whipped cream may have been my favorite part. Everything was perfection. My cousin had the S'mores Sundae which was a giant cold ice cream s'more. It was delish too, but the best part of hers was they lit the fluff on fire before serving so it even had the burnt marshmallow feel you normally get on a s'more at a campfire.

"I saw a review earlier calling out the affrogato here specifically, and I want to second that: in no way should the 5 stars I'm leaving be considered a general recommendation for everything here, as I haven't tried most of the menu, so I can't really comment. But, on recommendation of several previous yelp reviews, I just tried the affrogato, and it was seriously legit. It's a decent amount of soft serve, a decent amount of coffee, and they go *so* well together. The ""cereal milk"" flavor is very unique - it's not particularly sweet, which isn't necessarily a good thing in ice cream eaten by itself, but is just the perfect sweetness to accompany coffee. I especially like it because it's really two desserts in one: it's both perfectly-creamy high quality iced coffee (the coffee is served hot, but after melting a bit of ice cream around it, becomes refreshing iced coffee almost immediately), *and* tasty soft serve that's made better by dunking it in coffee before eating it. Highly recommended, and totally reasonably priced at $5, even if it weren't in the heart of the strip. I did try a couple sips of my my wife's cereal milk milkshake, and it was... fine. I wouldn't go out of my way to get that, and felt like $7.50 was a bit overpriced for it (that said, I personally think a rice-based cereal milk milkshake would likely be much tastier than the corn-based one they make currently. I'd come back to try that if they made one, which, to my knowledge, they don't currently.) I *would* absolutely get the affrogato again for $5, though (in fact, I just might get another one tomorrow, before we leave Las Vegas!) Edit: I did, sort of - I decided I had to try the ""crack pie"" affrogato, too. I told the cashier I was there yesterday and had to try the other one, she said I made a good choice, the crack pie's her favorite. It's good, but personally, I think the cereal milk is a much better affrogato (though the crack pie would probably better by itself - it's like 10 times sweeter.)",5,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"If you love soft serve, this is the place to go. There's history, tradition, the beauty of neon lights, plus really wonderful ice cream. You simply must experience the blueberry soft serve which is usually a limited time offering (not sure when it runs, but they had it there last night, June 8). Page is cash only, just so you know. It's definitely worth the trip. There's a small parking lot, so you can sit and eat your ice cream, as you may need to give it your full attention.

"There is an article that talks about Sweet Republic being one of the ten ice cream places you need to stop by in Phoenix. It has been on my list every work trip but I happened to be driving by while working and thought what a perfect time to take a break. I was so excited to try. The unique flavor profiles don't disappoint! If you have a chance to stop by I encourage you to do so... it is worth every single bite. When I walked in I told the girl making the waffle bowls that it was my first time and she was so polite and patient. She let me try whatever flavor I wanted. I was excited with every single one I saw. The peaberry coffee and pistachio stood out for me ... buy because of the heat I settled on the refreshing mint chocolate chip and honey lavender. Because I got a waffle bowl two scoops of ice cream, almond brittle, caramel and toasted marshmallow ... it cost me $8 ... your taste buds won't be sorry! Treat yourself and try it out. Tip: As an added bonus I was able to charge my phone which was perfect for my GPS which I was using for work. Each table had a nice charging station which was really great.",5,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"I have to admit I was a little hesitant going to the donut bar. After all, imho it had a large shoes to fill because of the prior tenant O Face Donuts. Sure, O face is now gone and one should not compare a defunct business to the next. But I cannot help it and I feel if you take the time to read what I mean, you may just end up agreeing. There is only one single difference between the two shops yet the difference is such a critical element. Creative originality. The Donut bar attempts to dazzle you with concoctions that are really just kids play. The creme brulee is creative in thought yet executed with no afterthought. Yea, the sugar is cool however only after one bite. Attempting to get through the constant crunch soon became annoying. I found myself trying to taste the center cream however once the sugar coating finally dissolved and my taste buds came to I found it to be just commercial custard filling. Very disappointing. The maple... O face had was one step ahead of everyone on this. When you go to a donut shop,no matter what part of the U.S. you go, you know what a maple bar taste like. It doesn't change and when you have one, you have had them all. O face however took the time to develop their own maple glaze which complemented the bacon. Donut bar..the same usual maple. The oreo cookie Jeez...how much sugar can you give? People, this is a regular glazed stuffed with an oreo cookie. mmmm Lard O face made donuts that were not only creative but containing other unique flavors. Mexican chocolate with horchata creme...yea, their own homemade horchata,not a tub filled with flavored gelatin goo Apple fritter. Dark. Happen to notice this to as the tray containing the fritters all looked the same,over done. To their credit, the inside was not overdone and actually the best of the group of donuts I had. In a nutshell, this is no O Face and probably never will be. I suppose this means I need to find something more on the level of my expectations. Which leads me to a final thought. Donuts that cost 2-4$ per should be on the level of artisanal. Otherwise, what am I paying for that I couldn't already get at Von's?",2,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Yummy. We were staying at the Venetian and this bakery just happens to be at the base of the elevators on the way from our rooms to the casino floor. To me, that's like sending a fat kid to a candy store and telling her to go at it. I love croissants. I love good coffee. If I could marry them, I would. Being from Portland and somewhat of a coffee snob , I was really impressed with my foamy and rich latte on the first day...I had to ask who supplies their beans. Bouchon Bakery had a really good espresso blend that is custom blended by Illy for them. Their lattes really hit the spot in a city where it seems alcohol is consumed in larger quantities than water. I couldn't wait to get up and hit this bakery almost every morning during our stay here. Once I was even asked by the cashier if I worked at the hotel because she had been seeing me around a lot. Their selection was all so drool-inducing but could easily leave a large gaping hole in your pocket. Not to worry, the sticker shock will leave you momentarily in a daze until you realize yes, you are on vacation and YES...it is WORTH IT. Their buttery, flaky croissants are excellent with jam on the side. Not to mention their red velvet cupcakes that were really moist and topped with soft sweet delicious frosting. They definitely have all the red velvet cupcakes sold in my hometown BEAT. These things are so popular they do sell out, so be sure to make your way here early enough in the day. My only regret is not going more often and trying out the macaroons but I am sure I will be back on my next trip to sin city.

"Best sticky bun I've ever had. The outer layers, which are typically dry, were light and flaky. The center was dense, moist, and loaded with chopped pecans. The entire bun was coated in a slightly hard, chewy glaze, reminiscent of pecan pie and topped with a mountain of pecans. $4 which in my opinion was quite a steal. Pastel colored french macarons in flavors including raspberry, coffee, chocolate, and when I was there (1/10/13), a seasonal peppermint flavor. $3.50 a pop and cute as a button. I got a raspberry one that was airy and chewy on the inside, firm but light and slightly crunchy on the outside, sandwiching a thin layer of ganache. Delicious! The unique texture is really an experience you have to try for yourself. The individual ones are larger than your typical macaron, but they also sell boxes of little ones for around $18. The long line that wraps around the display cases will give you time to drool and dream over the sweets that will soon be yours. Yes, the prices are a little more than you might be used to, but for quality pastry....in Vegas, the prices aren't that bad. Just sit down, shut up, and eat. 2 locations inside the Venetian!",5,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown
"Large taro macaron cookies sandwiching birthday cake ice cream with sprinkles. Great creation. Sweet tooth satisfaction.

They have a lot of options to pick from and even serve regular food like cold cuts, grilled sandwiches, and salads, but let's be real, nobody goes here to get that boring stuff. We're here for the Oreo milkshakes, brownie and banana split sundaes, and yum-ee buns (donut buns filled with ice cream.)

"A little backstory: I'm not an ice cream person. That's a strange thing to read, probably, because everyone loves ice cream. But it's true: I've gone months without eating ice cream (gasps). I remember eating gelato from a famous gelato place in Rome (that was in Eat, Pray, Love) and thinking it was OK, maybe even overrated. Initially, I thought it was awesome, but after some thought, I had to wonder if it was the place that made it taste good - Rome being romantic, beautiful and rich in history and all. But Handels ice cream -- I feel like I could eat blindfolded in some dark, dank corner of the universe and still think it tastes great. We Yelp-discovered this ice cream place in San Diego, and I almost fainted when I saw that we have it here in Vegas, too. With Handels, I'm finally excited about ice cream. I'm almost 40, so I've tasted a lot of stuff, and I know my sugar well. Pretty sure I've met my ice cream soulmate with Handel's. I'm also at a point where I think that if I get love handles (Love Handels) from eating Handels, I wouldn't hate myself for it. I'd be like, ""OK"". Handel's makes their ice cream fresh daily. Which means it tastes fresh, and heavenly. I've tried only a handful of flavors so far, but judging by the flavors that I've tried, I feel like the Handels were very discerning in how they developed their flavors. Their ice cream is delicious, but never overpowering. Their pistachio flavor (which I want to try next) should confirm this. Because every pistachio ice cream out there literally tastes like some plasticky almond. We shall see. Love you Handel's.",5,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

We got the Kilimanjaro which was 3 scoops of coconut ice-cream with coconut shavings, whipped scream, fudge, and a cherry but we subbed 1 scoop of coconut ice cream for the coffee bean ice cream because it just looked too good not to try. It was $9.99 and honestly for being a shop inside the Venetian I thought it'd be way more. There's also other cute snacks and desserts to try and bring home.

"If you're ever wondering where to get the best ice cream in the city, I'd highly recommend stopping by Jeni's before you head back home. Situated right in the middle of Southend, it's surrounded by sprawling restaurants, breweries, and eateries. Why not swing by after lunch or dinner and get some delicious dessert? That's the thought on everyone's mind; you'll always witness a large line no matter what time of day it is (with the night time being the most packed). It's a small little shop right next to Hawkers with minimal seating inside but lots of tables and chairs outside. Even though the lines can get massive at times, it always seems like it's worth the wait! As you get closer and closer to the entrance, you're greeted with a waft of fresh waffle cones being made constantly. The smell is inviting and definitely is a significant part of the experience. Once inside, you're greeted by a scooper and asked to pick and choose what flavors you want to try out and which ones you'll ultimately get. I'd recommend the Frose or the Wildberry Lavendar but I'm sure there's a choice to satisfy anyone's tastes! Once you check out, you can usually find seating outside on their tables or waltz over to the open area of Hawkers and sit there too. I usually like to chat with my friends while people watching, as there are usually lots of pets and little kids running around (making the atmosphere extremely welcoming and family-friendly). Ultimately, with the combination of how delicious Jeni's ice cream is, as well as it's welcoming atmosphere it's a sure winner during the peak summer months as well as any other time you decide to go. It's definitely one of the best experiences you could have, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone!",5,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive
"I finally had my first Mitchell's Ice Cream experience. Many of my Cleveland friends have bragged about their ice cream, so I had some high expectations...and they were definitely met! My first time there I ordered the Caramel Sea Salt (caramelized brown sugar and sea salt). It was delicious. The prices are a bit steep for a scoop of ice cream ($3.35) but when you get to the front of the line and see how big the scoop is and how tasty it is, it's not such a bad price after all. My second time there I ordered chocolate peanut butter cup, again a heaping scoopful. The chocolate ice cream itself wasn't anything special from any other high end ice cream, but there were so many big chunks of peanut butter cup, enough for every bite. My boyfriend ordered the chocolate malt ($4.95) both times (btw he tends to consider himself a malt aficionado). The first time they gave him a chocolate shake by mistake. It was good, but it was made with chocolate ice cream (I guess chocolate malts are not made with chocolate ice cream) and wasn't the malt he'd ordered...so he was disappointed. The second time we finally got the malt (this time made with vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup). He said he liked it, although not the best. To me the malt flavoring wasn't very noticeable and I think Sweet Moses makes better malts. Mitchell's put more malt flavoring in your malts! They use Hartzler's milk, I have never had their milk, but their egg nog is to die for (save that for another review) so I can only assume their milk is something special. Also it seems that most of the premium ice cream shops in Cleveland tend to use their milk. The store and building itself is also pretty impressive. You can go upstairs and view the entire kitchen from above, watching them make ice cream is cool. Also you know there's no funny stuff going on in there if you can see everything. Be warned, the lines can be long and seem impossible to get to the front in any reasonable time, but rest assured, there are a lot of people working the counter and those lines move really fast. Oh and they also let me bring my dog in with me to order my ice cream. I love places that are dog friendly! So many more flavors of ice cream still to try...a few blocks from home...I will be down there a lot this summer. Let's just hope my waistline can take all these visits.",5,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown

"You can't go wrong with a shop that has Perry's ice cream, chocolate covered bacon and cake pops among about 30 other types of treats! I wandered into the shop after being stuffed from dinner but still craving something sweet. I ended up leaving with more chocolate then I have ever purchased at one time before. I aslo left with an ice cream (Perry;s has a ton of unique flavors, my choice of the day was movie theater which had a faint buttered popcorn flavor along with some chocolate). My favorite by far was the chocolate covered bacon. How can you go wrong with the salty bacon combined with the delectable taste of chocolate? I also purchased a chocolate covered chili, some chocolate covered pretzels, some cake pops and a piece of fudge. Chocolate overload! There was only one person in the shop waiting on people, so it did take a little while to get service, but he was friendly and informative. The only downside is that since it is artisan chocolate, it is a little pricey, but totally worth every penny. If you are looking to satisfy your sweet tooth or try something unique, I highly recommend Sinful Sweets.",4,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"AmÃ©lie's offers two of my favorite things, pastries/tarts and coffee, but this location offered me one of me least favorite things, terrible customer interaction and service. The employees at this location are some of the rudest bunch I have encountered. When I arrived, there were no labels on any pastries and after asking to be helped we said that we were waiting for them to be labeled, they did not offer to tell us what they were. When they finally began to label after 5 minutes, we asked what kind of cake they had and two of the employees got into an argument about one not knowing what kind it was. While continue looking, three employees congregated up front to talk very loudly and poorly about one of their fellow employees and her work ethic. After finally getting up to the register and asking about their two blends of coffee, the employee was very rude and unhelpful, all I had asked was what kind of roast and its strength, she laughed and said ""I don't know"", so I ordered two of the same kind and she had asked if I wanted any room for cream or sugar and I politely and simply said ""No thank you"", I then hear her make a remark of ""Of course not"" to another employee and they both laugh. After finding a place to sit I realize the weight of my coffee seems very light and disproportionate to the size I got, so I decided to pop open the lid, low and behold there is almost 2 inches of room in each of the coffees I had ordered. I had immediately became disgruntled and walked back up to the counter and caught glares from the woman who rung me up and poured my coffee and 2 others like I had done something wrong, I calmly took off both kids and proceeded to show and explain that I had asked for no room and received the exact opposite, the helping employees offers to fill them up and realized they had run out from that brewer, but she immediately brought one up after that was fresh and proceed to fill up my two cups, only to still leave room. There was no apology made at any point, I was no rude to them and did not saying anything to aggravate them either. This was a very poor experience and will not recommend this AmÃ©lie's location to anyone, spend the money on parking and go to the Uptown location where you will have a much more friendly, helpful, and honest staff of employees.",1,unknown,unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

I thought the apple strudels were on the dry side and the eclairs were a little too oily/too much shortening in it. It left an oily taste in your mouth. I really liked the lobster tail and thought it was made perfectly. I'm sure these vary day by day. In any case, it was worth coming to Carlo's Bake Shop just for that.

"Wow. So glad I had the opportunity to check this place out in between moving hotels from old Vegas to new, mid-trip. My husband and I popped in here for a ""light"" breakfast knowing we had plans to hit up a buffet later in the day but I severely underestimated how amazing the sweet carb-laden goodness oozing out of this establishment would be. The variety of donuts served up here was fantastic; it was hard to choose just a couple (which was great because we ended up with a few complimentary options as well). Being from the northeast, my absolute favorite was the Maple Bourbon donut. It was so large and fluffy and had the perfect amount of glaze. My husband enjoyed his Red Velvet and we enjoyed some bites of a blue-frosted donut with Halloween-inspired sprinkles as well as another gigantic concoction with chocolate filling. Not a coffee drinker myself but I'm told the coffee is delicious. Street parking out front made for an easy in-and-out. Our leftovers were a nice treat after a late-night concert (as we were assured their quality would be good for up to 24 hours). The staff were incredibly nice and helpful in our decision-making and took their time reviewing all of our options. A must-stop in Las Vegas.

I found the Matcha to be very tasty and a very strong flavor it would probably taste really good with the vanilla in a swirl. They have a variety of other treats offered besides the frozen yogurt.

Wish I could give zero stars. What I will add is the huge lack of respect the owner must have for their own customers. I waited in line 25 minutes. And then another 30 minutes to get my stuff. Should of done what several people did- leave! Feel bad for the tourist who are wasting their precious time in Vegas to buy the crap they are selling here. Hire more employees to pack orders. Although this might be intentional to make people think they are more popular than they are. If you have a car - go to Bagel Cafe. GPS it. Much of what you buy at Carlos can be found here.

The cereal milk soft serve didn't do a thing for me and I love ice cream. Sadly, it tasted bland and wasn't sweet at all-- even with a generous heaping of corn flakes on top to give it texture.

"The cupcake trend is gone but this chain is still going strong and just opened at The Linq. Thought I'd try a place recommended by quite a few SoCal Yelpers. Did not expect to be as disappointed as I was. Tiny space leaves little room for a line, menu is large and not easy to read at a distance, save for the list of flavors and cute colorful caketopper symbols indicating which flavors are currently available. Service is a trainwreck. Even busy, this place doesn't need 6 people behind the counter, their ordering and fulfillment process makes no sense. Made it to counter, placed order for one single dark chocolate cupcake, plated to eat on location. My name was taken and I was told someone would be with me in a minute. I'm not sure why the same guy couldn't just reach into the case next to us and hand me the cupcake. Paying for my order was hectic. Girl misprounced my name to get my attention, gave me correct flavor, on a plate, with no fork. After handing me plate, asked for my card. Awkwardly set it down, retrieved card, then had to reach again for my ID- for a four dollar purchase, after waiting nearly 10 minutes. Really? Finally snagged a seat to eat. Cupcake frosting was good. Cake itself was dry. Just because I ordered at 9PM should make no difference to the quality of your product. Cake texture and frosting texture didn't really work well together, due to the extreme dryness of the cake and the hardened frosting topping. Opted for a cake without sprinkles, wanting to get the cute circle symbol instead. When I ate it, I nearly chipped a tooth. Given the low quality cupcake received dining in while they were still open (and busy), I'm hesitant to try the cupcake ATM. Can't imagine they retain their moisture well in what must essentially be a refrigerator.

Originally came in looking for rainbow cookies and ended up leaving highly dissatisfied. Dense and stale, no flavor whatsoever. This place is a sad excuse for a bakery that has simple treats that you can find anywhere else. A major disappointment and just another west coast bakery charging premium prices for average cannolis and fresh baked sugar cookies. I didn't come here for the name, I came here for the classic baked goods.

"Good ice cream and a pleasing environment combine to make Churn a wonderful destination. Churn is very small, so its popularity often results in lines out the door. Not always though. Lines were short on this Saturday night visit, although it was still a bit early. It allowed us time to sample, sample, sample. An enjoyable luxury. The friendly staff patiently endured the indecisiveness of our party of five. Of all the flavors we sampled, only coconut received a thumbs down, primarily based on texture. Just one or two scoop cones for all of us. I'm afraid no Fat Elvis sundaes this night. Simple peanut butter was my flavor of choice. Loved it. The five and six year olds were fully occupied by the pin wheels planted into their cones. Any flavor will do if there's a pinwheel to play with, confirming Churn's kid friendly status. Do not, I repeat, do not, just grab your ice cream and go. Walk to the back of the store and see if there are spots open on the patio. For me, the existence of this area is what pushes Churn into five star territory. Comfortable seating. Nice music. Relaxing lighting. The patio completes the experience.",5,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive
"It's a blustery night! 11 degrees. Snow is settling on the steps of Memorial Union. And inside, there's no one insight. COREY: Slow night? DAILY SCOOPER: Yup! But that's ok, this summer was crazy. COREY: I bet! Line out the door? DAILY SCOOPER: Yup! It's nice things have finally slowed. Which makes this PRIME time to go grab a cone if you don't mind cold treats in cold weather. Their pumpkin ice cream is sort of out of this world, with a color that resembles cooked pumpkin (not neon orange like some of that store bought shlock) and crisp graham pieces. Yes, ice cream in the winter might not be your idea of a stellar Saturday night. But if you're looking for something sweet, near campus, and like the fact that nobody else has the same idea... go grab a scoop!

I'd give this place 10 stars if it were an option! The ice cream is amazing. The doughnut or waffle sandwiches are to die for and come with a free topping - which I'm sure would all be super yummy but Cinnamon Toast Crunch is my favorite. Even better than the food is the service (if that's possible). We went for the first time last week and we're all blown away by how friendly the guy behind the counter was. Tonight we made a trip back down (we live on the north side) but realized they are actually closed on Monday's. When we pulled up we saw they were closed but the owner noticed us and said if we wanted to come in he'd be happy to serve us! We've never had someone invite us in on a day off just to make sure we were happy! We got to eat fresh waffle sandwiches and they were so good!

"This place comes highly recommended from everyone I asked when I visited Charlotte. I have to say that the hype was a real letdown when I got there. It seems that this place sees a lot of business, as evidenced by the line to be served, and the full seating area (which is ample, to be fair). I tried a croissant and a danish. The croissant was dense and did not appear to take to the filling very well. It looked deflated and sad. It tasted wonderful, though, save for the dense chewy texture. I had to check the menu on the way out to confirm that it wasn't one of the twice-baked croissants. The danish was good! I ordered a cafÃ© au lait, which is my standard go-to beverage when I'm not feeling like I need a full-powered drink. Granted, this place is not a specialized coffeehouse, but it does offer lattes and the like. My drink came barely hot with about two inches of foam. The coffee flavor was nothing special. If it were my first of the morning, It was okay, but I will probably go somewhere else for coffee. I would like to return to try a cake sometime on a future visit to Charlotte. This review is mainly for my experience there, which didn't include sampling a lot of the French pastries which were available.

And huge! They give you so much! I'm glad I traded out for vanilla ice cream because the chocolate would make it even more sweet and rich.

I feel like for this prices it maybe should've a bit bigger or maybe baked fresh? I'm not sure about the pie, but the cookies and truffles were already in plastic bags so they were a bit dry looking.

They had great flavor, but were so incredibly dry and old they should have never been sold and certainly not on display. Unfortunately the salted caramel brownies were over cooked and the caramel applied to the brownie after it cooled- so it separated as soon as you started eating.

It's really good!). You really come here to try the cool ones like cherries and goat cheese or Texas sheet cake. My personal favorite is the brambleberry crisp, but the menu is always changing with seasonal flavors so I love trying something new every time. The inside of the store harkens you back to a ""modernized"" old fashioned ice cream parlor, with all the staff wearing aprons. The staff is super nice, and they let you try as many flavors as you want. You even get to taste on real metal spoons, which is a lot of fun! They thoroughly describe the flavors, and make you feel like you're the only one in the store even though the line wraps outside the door for about 15 minutes.

"Yeah, I get the hype now. My first visit was above average, everything was delicious, but I left debating if the 25 minute line was really worth it or not. After craving some elevated soft serve, we made a trip back, and again, and again, and again. Each time trying something different. I get the hype now, this place is legit. They have a ton of different flavored soft serves, all of them are extremely well executed! Their sundaes are enormous and can easily be shared between 2-3 people. While the line may appear long, it does move quickly. Cash only with an ATM on site. The one thing I do wish they did is call out orders via a numbering system. They have designated spots for those who have ordered to wait by and hear their orders being called out, but you have to be paying attention to hear your order called, and know who ordered before/after you, as oftentimes people will get the same things, especially if they're running their seasonal menu. There's been a few times where a customer and I will be in a silent standoff debating if the Nancy B Cookie Sundae was theirs or mine. Would be much easier if they gave you a number which they called out, rather than calling out the order details.

I eat candy for breakfast. I put maple syrup on almost anything. But there was something that was just not there for me. And the same could be said for the cookies and milk shake we ordered.

Btw- it was portobello & onion, the mushroom seemed like an afterthought in decent french onion soup. I then noticed that the full sandwich I paid for looked very small(they only gave me 1/2 of my full sandwich-the pieces didn't match based on the diagonal cut). At this point, I didn't feel like even going back in to deal with the missing half sandwich. I'm sure someone in the kitchen enjoyed it. I liked my half of the turkey and brie.

"Mood - pastries Upon entering it began. The race to get the pastries. Some shelves were empty, as you walk thru in a semi nice orderly fashion and go to the next station, then an employee calls out fresh bread, everyone scrambles to that area, and takes goodies.

We opted for the premium milk, Taro swirl, egg tarts, and cookies, plus beverages. Can I say wow, and I can almost understand why people behaved that way. Interior is of course, the shelves full of goodies, roped area as you wait to pay, a small sitting area in the main room, and a larger seating area in the 2nd room.

I can't wait to try the other flavors next time. The chocolate croissant was to die for too. Crispy on the outside but soft and chocolate-y on the inside. What more could you ask for?!

Don't limit yourself to Fremont St when visiting downtown Vegas - especially at breakfast time. The donut bar is a block away and serves up some pretty righteous gourmet donuts. This aint Dunkin Donuts here - they've got some funky flavors like Reeses Peanut Butter topped with chunks of the candy bar. The flavor is fantastic and they dress em up all fancy like =) And the price is right too.

If you ever go to New York or Las Vegas, you HAVE to try this place.. i can't wait for the next time i go to las vegas cause my mouth is watering just thinking about those ginormous macarons. Until then i guess i'll just have to pay for overpriced tiny ass macarons :(. Til we meet again sweet airy delicious macarons. PST.. my cousin tried to eclairs and she said they were pretty good.

In the Fremont Street Experience Area, Donut Bar is a cute, small donut shoppe that was put on the map with its signature Big Poppa Tart donut (it has a PopTart inside of it!). Let me tell you: if you have a sweet tooth, you'll LOVE this donut. It was simultaneously filling and light letting me get my fill without bloating me. In addition, the workers were SO sweet and patient, telling me about all the donuts I had a question about.

The only problem with this small outlet near the sports book and clock tower is there is no place to sit. It is almost entirely takeout. The tart was boxed which wasn't necessary. I ended up removing the tart from the box and using one of their plastic forks to start eating the tart. I soon gave up and picked it up and ate it like that. There's a water dispenser at the bar with the plasticware and sugars/creams for coffee, but it wasn't working. After finishing, I went to the nearest bathroom in the casino to wash my hands.

Adriana strongly recommended the lobster tail to me and when I saw the strawberry shortcake it was too hard to pass up. I also purchased one of their cannolis to see what it was about. Ordering and paying was quick and easy. The staff was very nice and helpful too. I barely watched Cake Boss when it was on TV but I was definitely hyped for this spot and the hype is real! If you're going to visit, get the lobster tail for sure. The crunchiness of the shell and buttercream together are a match made in heaven!

He listened to my account and made it happen in 15 minutes! A similar situation occurred again on Mother's Day that the strawberry lemon slice was not available at 9 AM when I had been told that it would be. Once again, Kris made it happen.

"I feel like the hype is a little too much for this place. Don't get me wrong, I thought what I ordered was delicious, but the dessert doesn't seem to reflect the price for me. Pros: -The Cereal Milk ice cream with the Cereal topping add on is delicious! (The milk does taste like how it would after you eat all the cereal. AND the crunchiness from the cereal pieces on the bottom and top were a good bite!) -the cookies are laid out In their wrapping so you can see what they look like before buying them. -the cashiers are quite nice and helpful when it's your first time! -the crack pie was good -cute and picturesque packaging Cons: -To get here, you have to go to the Cosmopolitan on the strip. (I'm a local and not a fan or trying to just get dessert but having to get on the strip. Good for tourists though. Stay for less than an hour and parking is FREE!) -the portions of the Cereal Milk ice cream and the crack pie were fairly small. (Think the ""like it"" from Cold Stone if you know what I mean) -the price for each was a bit ridiculous for the amount and taste you got (in my opinion) Cereal Milk ice cream: $6 but extra $1.25 for cornflake crunch. Crack pie is $6.50 per slice and fairly small. I'm glad I gave it a try, especially since I didn't get to in NY, but I think I'll stay away for now. If I do go back, I hope to try their cake truffles and their cookies!

Nothing corny about a classic sweet Corn, the Blueberry & Cream is like a solid cheesecake without the cheese, and the Compost is all sorts of sugar, salt, savor, and crunch. We got half a Milkbar pie to go as well. It's the same thing as the crack pie with a family-friendly name because ""family-friendly"" is the first thing that comes to mind when I think about Vegas... They make it in ice cream too, and it's the best kind of sugar rush.

"If you have patience, you will find it worth the wait to get a crepe from CrÃªpes De Luxe. Taking a long overdue trip to the West Side Market from Lake County, it was important to get breakfast before buying all of the tempting goodies my fiancÃ© and I could carry. First word of advice: if you see there are fewer than 10 people in line, get in line. If you decide to come back, you will likely find the line got much longer and so, too, will be the wait. Another piece of advice: before you get in line, examine the menu carefully. It will be difficult to read once you get in line. There are a number of really great options to choose from, both sweet and savory, and you can also order your own custom crepe. Our tastes this particular morning were varied, so my fiancÃ© ordered the savory Florence (egg, spinach, Gruyere cheese), and I ordered the Black and Red, a sweet crepe of strawberries and Nutella (chocolate is an option to the Nutella). The ingredients were all fresh and most of them prepped right before us. The crepes were huge, very flavorful, and a substantial breakfast both of us enjoyed. Final piece of advice: Be sure to grab extra napkins because as you get to the end of your crepe it could become a bit unwieldy and fall apart. You might even wish to use a fork to enjoy these tasty treats with minimal mess.",5,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown

I ordered two coffee drinks and was treated like an idiot because I didn't know that a ""standard shot"" is actually two shots of espresso. I ordered one drink with an added shot. She corrected me telling me that drink is called something different when served in a cup vs mug, and when I received the drink from the barrista, she called it something different entirely! Who knew coffee could be so complicated?! The person at the counter spoke down to me, then went to chat with her coworkers while I waited. The drinks were not started until after they finished chatting. I asked for clarification on how many shots I was getting and she just did not do a good job explaining and made me feel like a moron.

Great ice cream. I had the goat cheese and cherry ice cream which had a nice sweet and tart flavor to it. Others in my party had the Texas Chocolate Cake ice cream. They didn't even notice it was dairy free and loved it just the same. In fact they didn't believe me when I said the sign said that flavor was dairy free. That's when you know they've got the flavor profile right! There weren't any tables out because of CoVid and parking is limited so plan accordingly. Some people were eating their ice cream on the steps outside the building but not the most comfortable option. We just ate as we walked back to our car.

The creme brÃ»lÃ©es were torched after we ordered them so they were perfect and so creamy. You could see the tiny vanilla bean caviar in the cream! It was soo flavorful. The brownie was like nothing I'd ever had before. It looked overwhelmingly sweet at first sight but when I took that first bite, I immediately went for another.

I had the pineapple sorbet in a cake cone and my boyfriend had the Vietnamese coffee. The Vietnamese coffee was very sweet and uses real coffee ground. Delicious! It was perfectly creamy and just like drinking a cup of Vietnamese coffee. The pineapple sorbet was very refreshing and crumbly. Delicious. The reason I took a star away was lack of preparation before opening and the only bad thing: stale cone. My cake cone was so stale that I took 2 bites of it and threw it away. Yuck!

"Churn is one of my two favorite ice cream places in the central valley (the other is Sweat Republic). Churn makes their ice cream from natural ingredients and it is good... like ""oh man that is good"" good.. They also have Illy espresso which is amazing by itself but even better poured over ice cream. There is one problem however... Churn has some of the WORST parking ever! It is right next to (and owned by same owner i believe) the Windsor, which also doesn't have enough parking... Given the parking issue and the recent opening of Sweet Republic on 16th st., I will most likely go there instead. I will say that Churn's ice cream is a bit ""milkier"" or ""creamier"" than sweet Republic's, but they have less adventurous flavors as well. You wont go wrong with either shop... If you can find parking at Churn. Update! Churn no longer has parking issues which is fantastic! They do however use some ingredients in their ice cream that are questionable if you are looking for all natural product...

"There are few things in life that make me as happy as really good chocolate and really good ice cream. Thus sweet republic is my personal temple to the ice cream gods, where I go to worship the two asian artisan ladies who invent the weirdest and coolest and most delicious flavours of ice cream I have tasted. Wow. Everything is made in house with real, fresh ingredients (as in real mint for the peppermint ice cream). On weekends you can enjoy caramelised bacon flavoured ice cream and their salted caramel is their overall best seller. Their sorbets are definately worth a try too. A tasty, lower ""impact"" alternative to their full cream varieties. Dont be shy to try exotic things such as their three cheese ice cream or chocolate turtle (chocolate with fudge swirls and cashews), my favourite. Whatever you do, order some salted caramel sauce on top of your creation if you have even the smallest hope it may go with your chosen flavour. It is THE BEST! And on a chocolate ice cream it is an absolute dream. The ladies are always friendly and happy to let you try their alchemical concoctions.

The attendants were very friendly/helpful and everything was very clean. There is a Sprinkles ATM (vending machine style) outside of the shop but the store offers more flavors. My husband had never had sprinkles and is now obsessed. I got the Strawberry Champagne and he got a Red Velvet. Both were so yummy. The cake was moist and the icing was flavorful without being too heavy or over powering. I am sure we will be visiting the Chicago location more often now! If you have never had a Sprinkles cupcake you haven't had the best. Get you some!,5,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown

"I should sue for false advertisement. The bag listed only 3 locations of Bouchon but then I come to find out that there are 5 locations (2 in NYC, 1 in Vegas, and 1 in LA). This bakery is hidden (at least in my eyes) because it is located behind and underneath the escalator at Venetian! If I recall correctly, I saw pastries (croissants, danishes, muffins), sandwiches (ham and Swiss baguettes), cakes, cupcakes, cookies, eclairs, and what I came for: macaroons. Macaroons sell at $3 a piece however, I must admit that they are huge and I should have opted that route however, being the fatty that I am, I bought a pack of mini macaroons for $13 (all flavors: coffee, chocolate, vanilla, pistachio, raspberry, and caramel). The macaroons were light, fluffy, and smooth (the filling)... I can't describe it in words that can fully justify the macaroons but I reckon I will be back every time I am in Vegas simply because I work hard and workout hard so $13 for a pack of macaroons that I can devour entirely in less than 24 hours? Hell to the yes. I should have bought 2 for the plane ride home.",4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Located in the Eastern and 215 shopping center, Somi somi has taken over the old Rolled Ice cream space. We went on opening day and it was a little bit of a cluster, as you expect from opening day. But we've been there 4 times since their grand opening, a month ago, and they have definitely smoothed out the kinks and now is like a well oiled machine. Somi Somi is a Korean inspired dessert place. Their signature is the Taiyaki, which is a fish shaped pastry filled with a filling of your choice: cheddar, Nutella, custard, red bean, Taro and Oreo. Taiyakis are 2 for $3.95 or 5 for $7.95. The taiyaki are perfection. Crispy on the outside and chewy and perfect once you bite in. We chose the custard, Nutella, red bean and Oreo fillings. All were really good. The Oreo was a little dry as it's just an Oreo cookie broken in half and placed in the middle. We also ordered the Ahboong $5.95 which is soft serve with a fish cone on top. Soft serve flavors change out as they are seasonal. When we went we tried the matcha, Oreo and ube swirl. The soft serve was thick and creamy. Tasted so rich, like frozen custard. Sooo good! Mashisoyo. You can choose a filling to fill inside the Ahboong as well but we opted not to. Once your order is ready, you go to the pick up counter and can add complimentary toppings like a macaron shell, sprinkles or a fresh strawberry. So incredibly happy to have Somi Somi come down to the Henderson area. A great new and fresh addition to the sea of restaurants on Eastern. Check it out you will not be disappointed. There taiyaki is the best we've ever had.",5,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
How do I start I love this place for their soft serve cereal milk Ice cream. I go out of my way at times just to go here for dessert. I live in Vegas so it's one of my go to places. I don't like the other flavors that much like the crack pie or salted pretzel way too salty for me and i don't know jus too much for me but they have another one fruity cereal that I love but they don't have all the time what a bummmer. I also recommend the cake truffles if you want a burst of sweetness in your mouth. You can also take them home and freeze them if you like!

"I have had several good experiences at Chocolate Shoppe, and I appreciate that they have vegan options! However, I was quite disappointed during my last visit. First, I ordered a ""vegan milkshake with ultimate oreo soy and peanut butter"" (peanut butter was one of the listed topping options, and I have gotten a shake with peanut butter at that location before). When I got my shake, it didn't look like it had any peanut butter, so I asked the employee if they included the peanut butter and they said ""the peanut butter cups?"" and I said, ""I actually ordered peanut butter, and I don't think the peanut butter cups are vegan."" The employee looked at me like I was an idiot and said ""it's confusing, but we don't have peanut butter... I guess I can re-make it without the peanut butter cups but no peanut butter"" and slammed it down on the counter. I said, ""no thanks, I'd actually like to switch to a scoop of the raspberry nebula soy in a pretzel cone"" and the employee said ""well the pretzel cone has dairy in it"" (this is contrary to what I've been told in the past, and I'm pretty sure the employee who told me that it was vegan had checked the ingredients list, so I'm interested to know what the correct answer is). I was so disappointed in the service I received that I decided to leave without getting anything, what a bummer.",2,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Milk Bar is a hit for a reason. I was skeptical, but all that skepticism went away upon trying the treats here. First of all, I will say this place is quite pricey for the small quantity you get. But man, is it amazing. The Cereal Milk soft serve is amazing, which has a slight sweetness but is accentuated by notes of saltiness, like actual corn flake cereal! We like to have this with the corn flake topping, as the crunch offsets the smooth ice cream. Another go to for us is the Crack Pie. It is called Crack Pie for a reason. Though it might be on the sweeter side, it is delicious. Similar to the Cereal Milk soft serve, it is a very sweet pie that is accompanied with notes of saltiness and bite to it from the rolled oats that are within. I hope you guys enjoy this place as much as I do!",4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

I got a marble taro bun, guava strudel, and a Hokkaido custard. All where amazing! The marble taro bun was very soft and chewy! On the inside there's a thick taro filling that tasted so comforting! It went so well with the bread! The guava strudel was very tasty! The guava filling was strong and the breading on the outside was very flaky, crunchy and not too sweet. I wish there was more guava filling! But, it was yummy! The Hokkaido custard was delicious! It tasted like a milk cheesecake! It was soft and creamy and the crust was baked to perfection.

"After watching tons of episodes of cake boss, you can bet that I really wanted to try these seemingly mouth watering desserts. I was absolutely thrilled that I could finally taste it, and not just imagine how it would taste! The appearance of the store imitates the Hoboken store from the show, and there's also a window where you can watch people decorating things, which is kind of cool. When I went, it was only the second day it was open, so it was pretty crowded. You take a number, and when it gets called you get to order your desserts. Then you have to get that same number called again so you can get it all packaged and pretty and pay for your stuff. There's not a lot of sitting room, so plan to take your desserts home. If you're really impatient, you could always sit on a bench by the ""canals"" in the Venetian and eat them while watching the gondolas. EVERYTHING LOOKS DELICIOUS! I settled on the ""lobstertail"", which is a pastry stuffed with I think it's french cream, since it seemed to be something sort of unique to Carlo's Bakery. It was so good! The outside was flaky and crispy, and the inside was rich without being too sweet. It was so perfect! I'm definitely looking forward to trying more desserts!

"A small shop tucked inside The LINQ shopping plaza leading to the High Roller Ferris wheel that I chanced upon when staying next door at the Flamingos. I've been to OG Ghirardelli location in San Francisco as well as the one on Hollywood Blvd in Los Angeles and am a big fan of their sundaes so had to indulge. As the shop is small it seemed pretty crowded even though there weren't too many people inside. Like the location in San Francisco there was a cutie at the door passing out one Ghirardelli chocolate square free to each person who walked in so that was a nice touch. During this visit I got the Warm Brownie Sundae ($9.45; most of their sundaes are priced around $10) and managed to get a high chair facing the outside window. As usual the sundae was excellent. Yes, it was pricy but entirely justified as they provide a healthy portion without compromising on product quality. Yelp check-in get's you a dollar off, so do use that. Surprisingly I've never bought any chocolates from Ghirardelli outlets just sundaes, so apart from the standard Ghirardelli chocolates that one can buy in any supermarket I don't have much to contribute. Goes without saying that this Ghirardelli location also gets two thumbs up from me.",4,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown

When I visited New York City last November (2012) I've been on the hunt for awesome macaroons because I've never really liked them until I tasted it there and one of the places I've tried was Bouchon Bakery.

On my most recent visit, there was an autumn apple ice cream on the seasonal board - a cider ice cream with caramel swirl and almonds, that I had as a caramel sundae. It was delightful. My only complaint is the amount of nuts used in the recipes - for those with nut allergies (not myself, but one of my friends who was with me), Mitchell's can seem limiting. He ended up with a scoop filled with brownie chunks that he was very happy with.

Bouchon is two stories and has a nice outside patio seating area on the first floor.The only downfall to this place is there is no inside seating. There were many pastry and drink options available on their menu including a TKO(Thomas Keller Oreo) and TLC(Oatmeal Pecan Cookie) that are unique to Bouchon. I didn't read about these gems until after we ordered but they seem to be a crowd favorite. I ordered a Almond Croissant, pistachio macaron, and Iced Chai. If you are a Chai lover, this is one is a must! The almond croissant was a little dry and flaky on the corners but was delicious. The pistachio macaron was massive and tasted great.

I do know that you can ask the server for a clean scoop but as all of their ice cream is hard packed, everyone else's scoop has already been in the container. Unfortunately this is one of those places that has great ice cream, but limited/no options for those who need something a little different.

The cuban panini was good, but when we were getting ready to leave we picked up a few bakery items to take for the ride home. What a wonderful surprise! The pastries were excellent. These may be some of the best we've had. Only wish we had gotten a couple of lbs of cookies instead of just the one & that we had grabbed a few cannoli's.

I ordered this strawberry cake, which is a perfect individual size. I was super excited to try it. The cream frosting had no flavor. It tasted like whipped, non-flavored air. The sponge cake tasted like spongy, non-flavored air. The strawberry juice soaked into the sponge cake tasted like cold water. The strawberry on top tasted like a strawberry. So I ate a whole cake to taste a strawberry on top. Super disappointed. I will stick to sunflour baking company",2,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"My boyfriend and I wanted to check this place out for awhile now, but the location is so far from where we live. The inside of this place is so cute and clean, definitely insta worthy. What I ordered was a cone mixed in with cinnamon toast crunch, topped with cheesecake bites. Costed roughly around $6. I've read yelp reviews about ice cream being costly, but lemme tell ya, it was so much ice cream, I couldn't even reach the cone!! It was so good and my tummy was so happy, but full at the same time. This ice cream cone could definitely be shared with others. My boyfriend got a milk shake with apple jacks mixed in. They also topped the milkshake with the cereal as well.

They where recognized by USA Today as one of the top 50 Ice Cream Parlors in the nation for good reason.

"Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this place. Granted, we stopped by at 9pm on a Saturday but they are open till 10 so figured we give them a try. My first observation is that in a fridge full of great looking cakes, none of them were covered. What I mean is when you start cutting slices from a refrigerated cake, you MUST cover the exposed inside of the cake with some type of food grade paper or cover to keep it from drying. Out of about 6-7 cakes *none* of them were covered. I thought ""these could not possibly be fresh and likely dry and tasting like a fridge"". So, decided to skip those. My wife opted for some sort of pastry that had a light cream filling in another cooler cabinet. Wow, I wish we would have taken a bite while at the place because when we did later in the car, we almost lost a couple of teeth. I mean, this thing was hard like a brick, tasted like freezer burn and was insipid. Horrible. Look, I get it that on a Saturday at 9pm I don't expect necessarily for things to have been made the hour before but I have eaten at late night bakeries such as Amelie's and I have never had to throw away something because it was not fresh. At VIllani's they clearly do not care what they are serving late at night. I get that maybe a few pastries would sneak in between the fresh batches but the fact that the cut cakes were completely exposed to the fridge air was proof enough that they simply are not trained in food freshness efforts. Tip to them: Cover your cakes, toss old pastries, and offer better. If the goal is to serve the drunk crowd from plaza midwood, then that may be good enough but not for anyone else.",1,Negative,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"I was beyond excited to finally try the pastries from here but I gotta say i was pretty disappointed... I got different flavored cheesecakes, canolis, red velvet cupcakes, crumb cake and these other pastries I don't remember the names of. The cheesecakes had no crust which is like the best part and they were overall tasteless. The red velvet cupcakes tasted like regular vanilla and the cream cheese icing was overwhelming. Canolis were VERY soggy! I couldn't even finish one because it felt like mush in my mouth. I dont even remember the other pastries. The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is because the crumb cake is beyond amazing and the guy who attended us was very friendly. Oh and another thing was that it was very difficult to get to the register to pay after we had chosen our things because there are sooo many people in the way and once we got there we had to reach over some guy to pay because he refused to move and the cash register lady didn't do anything about it.

Review we got this for the big brother & he liked it w/ the chocolate COFFEE CHOCO CHIP - My choice & it was good definitely had a whole bunch of chocolate chips in them which gave the coffee a more espresso flavor STRAWBERRY CHEESECAKE - Could use more if the cheesecake flavor STRAWBERRY x2 - Cant go wrong w/ strawberry CHOCOLATE - Chocolate is chocolate Will definitely have to come back to try some other stuff... but two of the 4 sampler scoops came out to be about close to $10,4,Positive,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"I was very excited to go to Carlos Bakery on my trip to Vegas. I love going to pastry shops when I travel and bring home some goodies as souvenirs. Pastries: Generally, the pastries are pretty good and they have a lot of filling!!! *Cannoli - Pretty dam good *Eclair - So much filling. Yum! *Lobster tails - There were four flavors and I got the hazelnut and one other. *Cheesecake - I didn't try this but my friend said it was average. Cons: - There are no price tags. Don't over order! I ordered six items for a little over $40... - Out of the six items, I was missing one cannoli!! When I opened the box after I got back to my hotel room, there was one missing! - The service wasn't that great. Basically someone on an iPad will follow you around and you tell them what you want and they put it in their iPad. I asked what a couple of items were and the girl seemed so annoyed. Honestly, she was helping me for less than one minute and she seemed like she hated her job. I want to give them more stars because the pastries were pretty good but the service was not great and they forgot an item!

"Awwww yeeeeeeah. Just went to this place for the first time and it was awesome. I had driven past it many times and my curiosity was piqued by the many signs all over the building with delicious-looking ice cream on them. So naturally I was super pumped to go to celebrate a friend's birthday. We pulled up and found parking right by the building, and then only had to wait in line a few minutes before placing our order. They have about 15 different flavors of soft serve, a whole bunch of different dips, different cones to choose from (pretzel, waffle, cake). They also have a whole bunch of delicious looking sundaes and Arctic blasts, and tons of other options. I went with a cone of the birthday cake soft serve dipped in chocolate. It was fantastic - the soft serve has a great smooth texture and the dip was on point. They also put a plastic sleeve on the cone to catch drips, which totally saved my clothes. My husband got the Yinzer Sundae, which had a blondie, vanilla ice cream, milk chocolate, white chocolate, caramel sauce and whipped cream. YUM.

The black sesame was really good, but wow, the marzipan blew me away. It had a rich almond flavor and wasn't too sweet. It went perfectly with the hot, fresh, egg waffles. I also loved the whipped cream on top. This is a small local business that makes its own ice cream in small batches. I hear that the flavors rotate every day, so there is a lot of variety.

So last night, I was happy to see the door open with its smiling ice cream painted walls inviting me from within. I walked up with the intent of checking out the flavors (WITH MY EYEBALLS) and walking back out to my people. I even announced as such to the couple behind the counter (spoiler alert: they're the owners). They smiled and kindly insisted I try one. Nah, I'm good. But then I saw the honey lavender, which is often too strong of a flavor by most ice cream shops. So they offered again that I taste. Well, maybe just this one.... And then they offered another. And then another. And I found myself falling into a black hole of needing ice cream that I was doing PERFECTLY FINE WITHOUT mere moments prior. But here's the thing, this isn't just ice cream that you can get at any old place. These are fresh, delicious, creamy, and perfectly balanced flavors. If I'm going to be eating ice cream, please know that it will be this ice cream and only this ice cream. Anyway, I ended up walking out with a scoop of the honey lavender. My boyfriend was intent on getting the sweet tiki and his friend couldn't leave without the Leslie Knope (waffle sammy) with sweet tiki ice cream. This is, of course, after they realized I'd been gone for so long that they had to investigate, then also found themselves coerced into tasting all the flavors upon the bidding of the ever-pleasant and obviously business-savvy owners.

So I called my family to see what else they'd want me to grab since they didn't save the coffee Cake. The girl who was helping me had a lot of attitude with me after that and they began snickering with other workers whenever I would ask for something else and then they would say it was out.

"Minus 2 stars for the absolutely horrible in store service. We were the only ones in the store and there were at least 4 employees, including the manager Priscilla, who was the absolute worst of the bunch. Right when we began to order, some employee (named Kat?) seemed utterly confused and annoyed that we wanted two separate orders. Is that such a difficult request? After she takes both our orders to the register, she gets confused and asks us if we want to pay together. I said no, and once again, I'm met with a confused look. After a bit of commotion, another employee asks ME what is in the box, and after I tell her I'm not sure, she throws the box back down and proceeds to leave. I'm not asking to be treated like a princess, but if you don't know what's in the box, can't you just open it and check if it's my order or not?! Now I was actually getting annoyed at this point so I asked for the manager. Turns out the woman who was too lazy to check what was in my box WAS the manager. Not sure if I caught them on a bad day or if they were too lazy to work, but thankfully there was one competent employee (blonde haired, tall male named Aaron?) who took the time to apologize for something he didn't even do. I would've just left without any macarons after all that attitude and sass, but since they are soo good, I had to suck it up and stay.

"Craving some ice cream on a Sunday evening, I decided to check out Handel's Homemade Ice Cream. Located in a busy shopping center anchored by a Smith's , I noticed the line building in front of Handel's as I pulled into the parking lot. At first glance there is a long list of flavors to choose from and a few stood out for my first time. There were 3 open windows to order from so the line went pretty quickly as customers seemed to know what they wanted. My turn to order I decided to try a scoop of chocolate chip cookie dough on a cake cone. The chocolate chip cookie dough was amazing and just the right amount of sweetness and texture. I wanted to try other flavors so I ordered a 4 flavor sampler pack which is a great value for first time at Handel's. The four flavors in the sampler pack were Coconut Milk Ice Cream, Graham Central Station, Vanilla Oreo and Oree Dough. All of the flavors were amazing but my favorite was the Coconut Milk Ice Cream which has no dairy but a great flavor and texture plus coconut chunks inside for a nice touch.

Not to mention the fresh squeezed lemonade made to order (yes, they squeeze the lemons right into your cup.) Burgers and fries are also made to order, so be prepared for a short wait while you prepare mentally for the heaven you're about to consume. I'm not a fan of their fries (they tasted like they were made in old grease) but wow that cheeseburger. I have a small appetite and can't usually finish most things - so when I ordered my burger and fries I let the bf know he was expected to finish it for me.

"I had the pleasure of visiting the LV Sprinkles Cupcakes & Ice Cream in April 2014, soon after they opened. It's always neat to see how each Sprinkles location differs, and this particular store just screamed ""VEGAS,"" from its light-up signage to the attention-grabbing cupcake ATM. This was the first Sprinkles store that I had seen actually joined--cupcakes and ice cream were not separated--which was neat but also confusing. I think that, because the store had only recently opened, they were still trying to figure things out. I entered from the ice cream side, but I was directed to stand in the line for cupcakes (when I wanted ice cream, not cupcakes). Hopefully by now, the Vegas store has everything a little more under control, because with two entrances, it can be easy for customers to get confused/not know where to go when it comes time to order. I was surprised to see that I didn't have to wait in an enormously long line to order my ice cream (there was a line, but it moved along). I appreciated the fact that there was a good seating area outside the store for customers to enjoy their cupcakes and ice cream -- more seats and tables than I have ever seen at a Sprinkles store. I ordered the seasonal ""Cookie Dough"" ice cream flavor--one of my favorites; I wish it were a regular menu item--in the ""Sprinkles Sundae,"" complete with my all-time favorite ""Peanut Butter Chip"" cupcake. I think because the workers were still getting into the groove of things at Sprinkles, the ice cream scoops were a bit larger than what I usually receive ... and hey, no complaints about that! The ice cream and cupcake quality were the same as I had experienced at other Sprinkles stores, which was great. However, I was a bit disappointed with the ""Salted Oatmeal Cornflake"" and ""Peanut Butter Pretzel Chip"" cookies that I ordered. Instead of the normal slightly crispy exterior and moist, soft interior, these cookies were on the harder, crunchier side, and the ""Salted Oatmeal Cornflake"" was definitely saltier than I would have liked. But, then again, gotta have some grace and patience because the store had just opened -- hopefully the cookies are a bit more consistent with the usual Sprinkles taste by now. The BF ordered the ""Sprinkles Shake"" with his usual combo of ""Captain Crunch"" ice cream and ""Peanut Butter Chip"" cupcake. The shake was as sweet as usual--I got a few sips in there--but we both noticed that the texture was also chunkier than usual. At one point, he had to use a spoon to get some of the larger cupcake chunks (definitely different from being able to inhale everything quickly with a straw). But he had no complaints--he said it was actually nice to munch on those cupcake bits every now and then. The friends we were with decided to share a ""Sprinkles Shake"" with ""Red Velvet"" ice cream and cupcakes (she really likes the ""Red Velvet""). They were extremely pleased with their foray into Sprinkles and said they would definitely get the ""Red Velvet""-heavy shake again (though, they were happy that they shared it, saying that it would have been too much red velvet for one person to handle). Overall, I had a positive experience at this LV Sprinkles. I really, really liked its dÃ©cor--the dazzling lights and huge marquee made it stand out from any other store I've been to so far--and the dÃ©cor really made the store easily spottable. I have no doubts that this location stays busy far into the night and keeps up with the Vegas nightlife. I do hope, though, for customers' sakes, that the ordering system is a bit more streamlined and organized to avoid confusion when entering/exiting the store.",4,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown

"EDIT- I came back to try something new at Milk Bar the other day because maybe I'm limiting my review on just Klossies (see review below). Caroline reached out and offered me to come back to try some other treats, and I honestly couldn't resist. I tried the fruit loop soft serve w/ cornflakes and the birthday truffles. The soft serve was pretty generous, and it tasted just like the cereal milk from a bowl fruity loops. The cornflakes were a little salty and crunchy which was great with the sweet soft serve. The birthday cake truffles come refrigerated but they aren't super cold. Maybe it's because I waited a bit to try them. They're the bees knees, so if you stop by, I'd definitely try the truffles! The customer service for me was great both times I stopped by, so no complaints here. Both times, the staff were very inviting and professional, so it makes me want to come back again for them. The drive still sucks if you're going to the strip during peak hours. Don't try to navigate the strip on friday and Saturday nights or during rush hour. It'll be a bit of a while to get through the traffic. Tldr- great service, try the truffles and maybe the fruit loop soft serve if you want to treat yo self. Driving here and parking still sucks, but I guess it's just something I'll have to accept about the strip. OG REVIEW- I've always wanted to try Momofuku's Milk Bar ever since I was in New York and saw that the line was way too long to stick around. Must be something that's good there right?! Ehhh, i'm low-key disappointed... and by low-key, i'm not just low-key disappointed.. I'm straight up disappointed. I got the perfect 10 and the coco klossies. For those of you who aren't familiar with what these are, they're the vegan cookies made/endorsed by Karlie Kloss, the model. The cookies were about $3-4 a cookie, and they aren't bad but they aren't definitely worth it for the price. They cost too much for just 1 cookie. If they were maybe $2 a cookie, I'd be more inclined to make the trek to the strip, sit in traffic, navigate the Cosmo's awful parking, and buy these cookies. The cookies themselves are slightly dense and very flavorful which saves these cookies. So all in all, the klossies are great cookies but definitely not worth it for the price and the annoyance of getting my butt through the traffic/headache that is the strip. If i'm already in Cosmo, then yeah, I'll probably go back but I wouldn't go to Cosmo solely to try their treats.",4,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown

These donuts were friggin' delicious and the spot is newly renovated and modern/hip. They are so creative with their donuts - there is no shortage of options here. We got a dozen and chose from a plethora of cake and fluffy raised donuts. Personally, cake donuts are where it's at for me - and Jack Frost makes a mean cake donut. I did find some of them to be a little bit over the top sweet, but.... it's a donut... that's basically why it exists. To put you in a sugar coma.

GREAT FOOD AND DRINK whether you are getting just a sweet treat (which there are dozens of options), or feeling something a bit more ""remplissage"" they have a full breakfast and extensive sandwich menu. 2. The atmosphere here is perfect, it's trendy, French inspired, and often times makes me smile or chuckle with how they pull it all together. 3. They are open 24 hours. Need some good coffee and breakfast at 4 am before a flight but don't want fast food? They got you. Been out in NODA drinking craft beer and want a tasty nightcap? Come get a salted caramel brownie.

"How have I not already reviewed this place considering how often I try to drop by when I'm in the matthews/ballentyne area! This is a MUST TRY if you're in Charlotte. Okay so this place is amazing and you absolutely need to visit to get your matcha ice cream and other dessert options as well! It's a small cafe with much-limited capacity due to COVID but they're accomodating and doing their best which I appreciate! The ice cream is definitely the must get item for 1st timers since it's creamy and delicious as well as pretty accurate to the matcha flavors I've had in Japan. The vanilla with matcha is a good match if you're not used to the bitter taste of matcha that can be acquired, but that combination is great no matter what! I've also had hojicha (burnt matcha?), black sesame (seasonal), and ube (seasonal) and all those are great as well! Hojicha is still one of my favorites with match ice cream. The black sesame is good as well if it's an option. The ube is a lot lighter than I expected so if you're expecting that rich flavor you've had a Filipino places, you might have to curb your expectations a little bit. I've only had the other matcha ice cream with all the toppings that I forget the name of and I'd also recommend that if you're in a hungry mood or want to share! I've had that several times in Japan and this place is up to par for this dessert option! Parking is pretty easy and there's a lot of food options in the area. Or if you want boba, kung fu tea is also a short walk down because my mom wanted boba more than ice cream so there's room for everyone :D I'd say drop by if you're in the south charlotte/Matthews/Ballantyne area, but really if you're in Charlotte this is a MUST STOP AREA you have to try. It's unique and leaves a lasting great impression.",5,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown

I have no idea how the canolis, bread, sandwiches, or stromboli taste... but I know the Gelato is pretty good. While service wasn't warm, it wasn't bad. The decor is light and cheerful, and despite numerous other empty restaurants nearby, this one was mostly full. So, despite mediocre service, we had good gelato, and colour us satiated. :)",3,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"$17.50 for a box of 6 macarons. Why can't they all make it this big? I tried every flavor except for pistachio and raspberry. The only thing that should taste like pistachio nuts is pistachio nuts. I gave my raspberry one away and the recipient of this macaron did not offer me a bite :( The coffee one was definitely my favorite.

There are also crunchy chocolate rice balls at the bottom of the crepe to make up for the lack of crispiness there which is so nice!! I definitely recommend this place for their crepes.

I loved the floral flavor, but felt the sweetness should have been toned down a little bit. The other person with me whom ordered a jasmine milk tea ordered a Thai iced tea. They said that it was better than a lot of the restaurants we previously ordered Thai tea from.

"I've written a review of Donut Bar in San Diego. Well, we were visiting Vegas and stumbled across the Donut Bar while driving around and exploring. I had my husband stop immediately and I got out of the car and checked the business hours. We were staying at the Aria and planned to wake up early to ensure I didn't miss out on the creme brÃ»lÃ©e donut that I missed out on while in San Diego. The next morning, we drove to Donut Bar and there was no line. Talk about excited!!! Again, the employees were warm, welcoming, and patient. The service was cheerful and the employees were all smiles. On to the donuts. Needless to say, these donuts are great. This time we bought the strawberry split (our fave), the apple crumb (hubby barely tasted it last time cuz I ate it), the salted caramel, and of course the creme brÃ»lÃ©e. The strawberry split is our absolute favorite!!! The donut is light and the filling is light and airy without being overly sweet and the fresh strawberries brings it all together. The apple crumb is more like a light cake that has a hint of apple. The salted caramel is like a glazed donut but the glaze it caramel. This donut was good but I think a little more restraint on the salt would balance it better. It wasn't my favorite but it was good. Now on to the donut that got me up early in the morning, the creme brÃ»lÃ©e! This donut was actually really good but I'm still partial to the strawberry split. At first glance, it looks like a typical filled donut with a hard glaze. I cracked the glaze and opened the donut to expose the creme filling. Creme brÃ»lÃ©e is my favorite dessert and I was pleasantly surprised to find that the custard was spot on. Without a doubt, I will be returning to the Donut Bar!",5,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"I was visiting Charlotte for my best friend's birthday weekend. We stopped in twice this weekend and I really enjoyed this bakery. The staff was nice and very helpful and patient explaining what the items were. I ended up buying a raspberry fruit tart, pistachio macarons, and their seasonal passion fruit strawberry lemonade to drink. All were really good! The tart was sweet, but not too sugary. Just enough tartness to it! I just recently started enjoying macarons and this was so fresh. The passion fruit strawberry lemonade had stronger hints of passion fruit and sparkling fruit soda, the strawberry lemonade taste was not as strong on my order. It was really great!!!

The first bite was extremely unsatisfying and honestly pretty disappointing considering we paid $19 for a pint of it. The birthday cake crumbles are super dry and have a distinct salty taste which is so off-putting in ice cream. The sprinkles are giving everything they've got to save the entire experience but unfortunately it's not enough. If I were you, I'd seriously consider going to one of the extremely overpriced convenience stores in the hotel and getting an overpriced ice cream as it'll be better than this and you'll still come away spending less money.

I absolutely loved this quaint little place and they had plenty of comfortable seating. The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars instead of 4 is the simple chocolate cake we ordered was a tad dry and the buttercream was hardened. It was as if the cake had been sitting out too long in the fridge and it was almost to the point of being stale. I've heard people rave about their delicious cakes so I'm going to assume we just got there on a day of a bad batch. The latte's we got were fine, nothing too special.

"You guys in the Upper South End area are so lucky. Between all of the trendy restaurants and bars, now you have an amazing Ice Cream spot too? So, Jealous, over here. I can't complain too much, I live in North Charlotte, my office is in South Charlotte, and my job involves traveling everywhere in between. So I get to see and visit any noteworthy business in the QC with relative ease. Jeni's is no exception to the list of 'noteworthy' places in my book. Between the kick-ass ice cream flavors and the friendly staff that know way too much about their product (and just ice cream in general), this place is a prime example of what every business should strive to be. So what makes them stand out? The flavors really are ""next-level"" exciting. Between Brambleberry Crisp and the Goat Cheese w/ Cherries, I couldn't tell you which one I crave more. That's right, I said goat cheese! You're probably thinking that goat cheese doesn't belong in Ice Cream. Well, why not? Who's this absolute authority that says what can and can't be Ice Cream? Forget the norm and live a little, darn it! Hats off to the staff. Everyone in the building is quite adept at the craft. How about finding out that ""Darkest Chocolate"" flavor has so much chocolate that if it had just 1% more it would ""legally"" have to be called fudge! They have a little morsel of knowledge for every flavor they sell. They also make fresh waffle cones. You can literally smell the caramelized/nutty/sugary aroma from three blocks down Camden. Everyone on site is as nice as can be, you can try any flavor you'd like and they even have metal tasting spoons. Some flavors are amplified versions of true classics, and some are truly unique creations that push the boundaries of what Ice Cream can be. Maybe it's best that I don't live around here or I'd be as big as a house in mere months. Just a small drawback is that on my last two visits, they've been out of one or two of my favorites. When the ""Flight"" of minis comes with three different flavors and a wedge of waffle cone, missing two flavors you're looking forward to is a real bummer. That being said, any substitution I've got here is always top notch. I've never got a bad scoop here. Splendid is such a good description for Jeni's.

Great place for amazing pastries and desserts. We passed by this place every morning on our way to the Strip but never went in until our last day in Vegas. Kind of a last minute decision to come in to check it out and we were glad that we did. Lots of tempting options at the counter. We would love to try every single thing available but we knew that we couldn't do it so we settled with a chocolate almond croissant and a strawberry lemonade macaron. Omg they were delicious. Some of the best desserts we had in Vegas. They were so yummy that we came back and bought some macarons and croissants to bring home. We would love to come back to this place again for more tempting sweets the next time we are in Vegas.,5,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"I went to Milk Bar in NYC and I've been craving the Crack Pie ever since my last visit there. I ordered the Crack Pie ($6.50) here and it was nasty and disappointing ugh. It tasted like straight up butter so this ruined my craving boo. It was not the Crack Pie that I enjoyed eating in NYC. However, I liked the crack pie soft serve ($6) which I ordered with rainbow sprinkles (50 cents more) which was sweet! I enjoyed the Confetti, Compost, and Cornflake Chocolate Chip Marshmellow cookies (3 for $8) as well which were way better than the crack pie unfortunately.",3,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Melt isn't the same as it used to be. I was a regularly customer for several years until they and sister-business Jobot were forced to move two streets over to ""gentrification central"" under Roosevelt Point from their original location on 5th street. In the past 2-3 years, I've seen a great decline in taste and quality of their ice cream and overall customer service. They have gutted many products and taken away several ""classic"" flavors from their arsenal. I am not sure what has been happening but I hope it changes soon because the Melt that I had come to know and love just isn't the same anymore.",3,Negative,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

Their pastries are so ridiculously good - you really can't go wrong with anything on display. Their macaroons are monster and the size of your face, but my favorites here are the croissants. The almond croissant, the chocolate, and my personal fave - the strawberry croissant are all to die for. Perfect flakiness, sweetness, and the texture of the smooth strawberry filling...omg.

"There are a few things I like about this Bakery, the top reason has to be the balance of Bread and other bake goods it offers. I love bread, but most bakery I found is just pastry shops, cookies and cakes, etc. No bread. It is very hard to find good quality bread. This bakery has a good combination of bread, croissants, and other sweet stuff. The second reason is that it is a local shop, not a chain or a franchise, so that's worth an extra star. As far as the quality of the bread and pastries, it ranges from average to very good. I would not say anything is out of this world, but I do wish I had a bakery like that in my neighborhood.",4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

We visited late at night so the staff was ready to get us out of there but always stayed kind and efficient. The pastries and deserts were absolutely delicious and come at a fair price for the quality. They offered a fair bit of outdoor seating along with having plenty of indoor seating.

"Breakfast quiche! Cookies! Gelato! How can you NOT be a fan of this place? It really is a Cleveland institution. I like to come here from breafast all the way to my afternoon snack. For breakfast, I like to get their breakfast quiche or the croissant sandwiches. They're super buttery and flaky and filled with egg and cheese and your choice of breakfast meats. They're hearty and filling. For my mid-morning snack, I'd pick up a few cookies. There's an assortment of cookies and you purchase them by weight. I often like to get a few of each. It's not too expensive considering the amount of butter that's in these babies. You can taste the clogging of your arteries -- now that's a damn good cookie. For lunch, they have a lot of meal combos. From the Italian favorites of meatballs and cavatelli to a quick lasagna, they've got your lunch meal ready for less than 10 dollars. I often get one for there (they'll heat it up) and one to go (they close pretty early so dinner is sometimes not an option). For my afternoon snack (I sometimes like to stay inside all day because with their free internet and delicious coffees, I can afford a study date there), I like to pick up a pastry. They used to start selling their morning donuts at a discount starting in the afternoon. It seems like their donut chef has recently left and so there are NO MORE donuts. But that's alright, I suppose, because I'm filling the donut hole in my heart with plenty of chocolate tirimisu and lemon tarts. But if the pastry gods are listening, please bring back the donuts!

The Peanut Butter boasted true PB taste without being too overpowering - probably would be a great pairing with Strawberry ice cream and, of course, Chocolate. The Mint Cookie had that perfect not-too-minty taste with slightly softened chocolate cookie chunks. This one was our fav of the two, though both didn't disappoint.The mouthfeel was quite smooth and didn't leave any of the butterfat film on my mouth or grainy texture. It was frozen to the perfect degree, not too hard or soft. Looked to be about 16 different flavors to choose from at any given time and they offer a unique pretzel cone for those looking to mash up their sweet with a little salty.

The staff are usually friendly and efficient, and the price is reasonable for a cone or cup of your favorite flavor. Mine is the chocolate and peanut butter. This flavor seems to be hard to get at the grocery store, but the Babcock version of it they serve at the Daily Scoop is the best I've ever eaten.

Got there at 1140 on a Friday so there were only three types of donuts left; Crete brÃ»lÃ©e, strawberry cheesecake, and Nutella overload. I wasn't disappointed with the lack of selection as I would have chose two if the three anyway. They were dry, and all disappointing in flavor. The brÃ»lÃ©e topping tasted burnt and not sweet and the cream was almost tasteless. The strawberry cheese cake was a jelly filled with cheesecake icing I guess? Not enough filling , couldn't taste anything like cheesecake, and the filling tasted cheap. The Nutella overload an underload with not enough filling. It was straight Nutella which was the only saving grace of the donut experience. They did have nitro cold brew which I tried and it was good but their cold brew was bitter and not smooth.

"Ninety's has been a staple in University area for quite some time now and they recently revamped and renovated the interior of the store. The menu was also revamped, with there now being a main focus on ice cream and desserts offered. The last two times I got the Yum-eee bun and both times I got the S'mores one with graham cracker crumbles, chocolate ice cream and marshmallows wedged between a heated up glazed donut. Each time I feel like I tasted more of just the donut and the ice cream than the graham cracker crumbles and marshmallows, but the concept is interesting and is a great treat if you are looking to indulge a little bit. They have other types of Yum-eee buns and you can also create your own. In addition, they have traditional ice cream offerings, macaroon ice cream sandwiches, cookie dough pops and cereal milk shakes as some of the things you will find here. It's pretty original compared to anything else in the area. Prices are a little high in my opinion for some of the things they offer, but the place seems to do really well, especially since remodeling the store.

I got to sample the flavors - crack pie and cereal milk. They were both decent in flavor. I ended up with cereal milk and the worker convinced me to get corn flakes on top ($1 extra) by saying that it was really good with the corn flakes. Honestly, unpopular opinion but... it wasn't good. They were WAY too salty and didn't really add much to the soft serve. Also, the soft serve was too soft - bordering on watery. My friends got the cookies - they tasted burnt to me - and the crack pie - really good, but really expensive. Overall, this place was not for me. Super basic and overpriced soft serve, I would most definitely choose McDonald's soft serve over this place.",3,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

We grabbed a dozen box and were greeted with some pretty awesome counter girls! After we chatted for a few we went to leave and my new bride tripped on her dress and dropped our cupcakes all over the place. One of the girls came running out to see if we were OK and then told us to hold tight while she helped us out. Literally a few minutes later she came out with a brand new box of cupcakes free of charge and that there was also a special message waiting inside the box. When we got back to our room we opened the box and the cupcakes spelled out Tie The Knot IN CUPCAKES!!!!!! Needless to say we were blown away and called the store back right away to rave about our experience. They went out of their way when they didn't have to and you don't see that every day, anymore. Oh yeah, and the cupcakes are BOMB! 7 down, 5 more to go! Great frosting, super moist cake but best of all SWEET service.

"My favorite bakery. Even more than Jean Philippe. Bouchon is relatively cheap and gourmet. I got an iced mocha, better nutter cookie, TKO cookie, and one of the plain baguettes for about $17. That's cheap even if not on the strip. The cookies are huge. Iced Mocha - rich with quality cocoa powder. The best mocha I've ever tasted. Has notes of coconut from the rich cocoa powder. Get it! Macarons - best macarons IMO. They are big too. No hollow shell like some places. Perfectly soft with the nice macaron shell crust. Not chew like some places, although I'm not against the chewy type macarons. These macarons melt in your mouth. Cupcakes - I saw a giant cupcake for $3.25. They are in between the jumbo muffin and regular sized muffin cups. I've never tried any of their cupcakes, but they look really good. $3.25 for a cupcake is a steal these days considering Sprinkles at the Linq charges somewhere around $4 I think. Better Nutter cookie - GET IT. Even if you don't like peanut butter. This is like a peanut butter lover's dream come true. My mom isn't fond of peanut butter but she is absolutely obsessed with this. The cookie has bits of peanuts in it as well as peanut butter I believe, the cream filling is a peanut butter italian meringue buttercream. OMG, it's soooooo good. TKO cookie - chocolate butter cookie with white chocolate ganache filling. Meh, it was okay. I wish the filling had some vanilla flavor, but it was really just cocoa butter flavor and cream. I think vanilla would've helped the flavor shine a bit more. The cookie is also really soft. It was hard to break pieces off. But hey, that means you don't have to share. The chocolate cookie itself was good and not sweet. It balanced the sweetness of the filling nicely. Bread - it's their standard baguette they serve at dinner in their restaurant. They toast it up for you if you want and ask you if you want jam or cream cheese. The bread does get hard after it cools down, so better eat it while it's warm. Nice crust and chewy. Great aroma. Americano - the first place I've ordered an americano that tastes creamy without anything but espresso + water. I don't know how they managed to do that. If you need a dairy-free option, get the Americano.",5,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

I rounded a corner and saw it. a big building. It looked like any other but inside I knew was something special. I pounced through the doors and was assaulted with smells like no other. so many good smells in one place overwhelmed me and I screeched and ran. I finally worked up the courage to go back yesterday and crawled up to the counter.

This one is my favorite of the Amelie's. Maybe because it was my first but I think it's because of the quaintness of the place and the many places you can sit with friends or get some work done.

"I love the size of these donuts! For donut fanatics like me, it is a glimpse of nirvana to see a giant fresh donut with delectable toppings. And the variety! So much to choose from, I get paralyzed when I want it all. I can't decide! And kudos to them for not serving all cake donuts, which is what many bakeries do so that they can stack multiple toppings and glazes on top without them losing their shape. Nope, Donut Bar serves nicely soft, huge yeast donuts, which is comparatively rare. And yummier :-) I chose the Brad Fritter with bacon and caramel, a blueberry cheesecake filled, and a lemon pistachio ""glazed"" yeast donut (small tire sized). Took me 2 days to finish them, such is my gluttony. They serve a nice assortment of caffeinated drinks to wash them down. Not a whole lot of sit down space, but that's the only shortcoming really.

"Their ice cream is wonderfully distinct without being pretentious. They work out of a humble converted house; divided in two and selling their sweet creations out of the left half. Parking is plentiful because there are streets all around. The outdoor seating was a perfect view of the blood moon tonight. I really couldn't ask for a better ice cream experience. I love the brandy/toffee ice cream which was one one of the five flavors I tried in my flight. I think their fudge brownie ice cream has the highest brownie to ice cream ratio I've ever had. I really like the chocolate rose pistachio, it was such a strange mix but it worked. I'm very glad I stopped in for a bite.",5,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown
Pricey but pretty good treats. I've been to the LA location a few times and I probably prefer this location better. I am usually a fan of their cookies and ice cream. The last time I came here was when I stayed at the Cosmo. I do not drink dairy and asked them to make a Milk and Cereal Latte for me with something non dairy. So I guess they couldn't with that option so I went with their regular size Birthday Cake Latte with almond milk instead ($6.50). I didn't think it was anything super special but it was good and I was glad I got it. I also got their Gluten Free Birthday Cake Truffle which I highly recommend ($6). It comes pre-packaged with three truffles inside. The packaging is cute and they were SO GOOD! I definitely recommend them. I do appreciate that they have non-dairy options and gluten free options available when not many dessert places do. I also like that most of their sweets are pretty good but just pretty pricey.,4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

The cookies are large and everyone enjoyed them, you have to be pretty bad to mess up a cookie. My rating is lower because I'm a celiac.

"Every mall needs an Eataly for real. La Pasticceria is the pastry section with things like tiramisu, fruit tarts, and cannolis. I came by on my last day in Vegas for a caffeine pick me up because I was exhausted. All of their espresso drinks came in hot or iced and had 3 sizes to them. Price-wise it was slightly more than starbucks with their iced latte in the smallest available size being a 12oz for $4.90 before taxes. It was very good though. Strong, smooth, and creamy. As a bonus they had paper straws available. Vegas is kind of behind with respect to their conservation initiatives (no separate recyclables) so the paper straw is a nice step.",4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"Stopped by on 1/21 as it was near a place I was at. I wanted some breakfast and decided to give it a try. The location was clean, with items being restocked and rotated throughout. There were plenty of items out at 9:30am, with the option to order your drink ahead via a kiosk before selecting all your pastries. I opted for a Matcha Bun that had chocolate in it. A Twist that had raisins and a sweet filling, and also a bacon cheese roll. All of the items were individually wrapped, with things still available to pick up things. I did like this but I do think it's quite wasteful with all the added plastic. As I was checking out, I added a Rose Milk tea (hot) to my order. My total was $10 which wasn't bad for 4 items. The tea came out fairly quickly so I didn't have to wait and the cashier was quick too in checking me out. The Matcha Choco Bun - normally I don't like filled buns (not into the creams inside) but this was actually quite good! Not overly sweet and good texture. The Coconut Twist - I was surprised to find raisins inside as I didn't expect that but it was good and the filling was good as well! Not too much of a coconut flavor, however, it paired perfect with a warm drink. Rose Milk Tea - this was ok, not the best I've ever had but good! The flavor wasn't too artificial (some rose flavored drinks tend to taste like bitter petals) but this drink was balanced well in flavor profile. I do wish they had more combinations as I like rose with match. Bacon and Cheese Bun - I ended up eating this the next day (right before typing this). I microwaved it for about 15 seconds in the plastic bag, and it's so soft and perfect! Very delicious and not stale at all considering I had it a day later. I would definitely buy this again next time! I recommend giving this bakery a try!",4,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown
"So went back today. Got 6 donuts to test. The vanilla cream, maple glaze, chocolate glaze and even the plain glaze for a glazed donut were all different. The glazed donut was still decent, despite the change. However the maple is just awful, thankfully tho the cake donut itself was still good. The vanilla cream improved over our last trip, so that was positive, but the chocolate glaze went downhill. I just can't fathom why they would change a perfectly good product. The donuts remain the same, delicious, soft and fresh. But the toppings need some help. Bring back the old recipe or the old ingredients, we can taste the difference and we are not happy :(",4,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Part of my favorite morning routine before I stepped out of the Venetian to hit the Strip was to stop at this small bakery outside the hotel and nibble on their delectable goodies. Their huge slider-sized macarons caught my eye when I first walked past and I knew immediately I had to come give them a try. Oh, and these babies? The Queen bees of macarons as their gargantuan bodies stood out amongst the vast array of smaller, more delicate confectioneries and other irresistible French baked goods on display. I purchased their Pistachio, Vanilla and Chocolate macarons and, not surprisingly, Pistachio was my favorite - I've been completely smitten ever since! Quite possibly the best Pistachio macarons I've ever had. The cookie shell was perfectly crisp, yet easily giving way to the pillowy soft goodness within as you take bite after delicate bite - sigh, Heaven. The prices were great too at $3.50/each. I also tried their croissant which wasn't bad as it was buttery and flaky. Honestly though, I just wish Thomas Keller can open a Bouchon Bakery closer to where I live as I now have a new, potentially lifelong, obsession with their Queen-sized macarons!",5,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
Terrific doughnut stop! Easy to locate. We got a nice assortment and we were pleased with each. The tiramisu doughnut was piled high with creamy white icing. They are very generous with all icing!

Lil Olivia said it was sweet and savory. The only thing I didn't like was that their was only about 10 chairs inside for dining. We had to go to the back patio and it was a little chilly but it would be cute if a little warmer. I am really glad I tried this spot and the prices were pretty cheap.

"Ok first off, this place SMELLS like heaven! (What I imagine heaven smells like, anyway) The line was quite long for pastries. I waited about 20 minutes before it was my turn but it was well worth the wait. There's so many desserts to choose from, but I chose a regular cannoli, chocolate cannoli, white chocolate mousse cake and a hazelnut cream puff. I really wanted a black and white cookie but unfortunately they were sold out for the day. Everything I chose was delicious! My favorite would have to be the white chocolate mousse. At $9.95 I was a bit skeptical on whether it would be worth the money but I'd happily pay this again. I may have eaten the whole thing by myself.............. Not sorry. The cannolis were awesome. They tasted homemade, as they should. I preferred the regular cannoli over the chocolate covered one. I recommend letting them sit out like 10 mins before eating them because when they're straight from the fridge it's a bit hard to bite into. It tasted better when thawed out :) Good thing I don't live near Carlo's because I'd be super fat if I did (but I'd be happyyyy)!",5,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown

I've bought better Italian cookies in Publix, in Florida. Honestly, Great Value Cooke's far out-class what I purchased today at Carlo's in the Venetian. Mama would be vety, very disappointed, Buddy. What is also amazing (not really) to me is that for all the reviews here on Yelp, there isn't a comment back from the company. I guess Buddy and his gang are just too full of themselves and too rolling in dough to even care that their quality is so pathetic. Guess they believe that there are plenty of suckers born every minute.

"Friendly and sweet service. We tried the pomegranate sorbet, the banana ice cream and the butter finger. It was good, wasnt spectacular. I sampled the coconut milk and strawberry and it just tasted funny. The service was sweeter than the ice cream. Minimal shade in the seating area. Napkins werent readily available, but I asked and she happily gave me them and even got them wet for me. Packaging is super cute and they give you whatever samples you ask for w a smile. Ice cream gets 3 stars, & for $4 a pop, that wasnt the business, but service gets 5.",5,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"If you love creme brulee, then run to Sprinkles before July 31 for their seasonal ice cream. This was the second time that ice had Sprinkles. I decided I was going to try one of their cupcakes as well as some ice cream this time. I was going to get their Cap n Crunch ice cream, until I saw that their seasonal flavor was creme brulee. I couldn't pass that up. I got the ice cream sundae where you pick out a cupcake and they cut it in half and put a scoop of ice cream in between. Delicious! I tried the vanilla cake with chocolate frosting and sprinkles. My boyfriend got the Cap n Crunch and coffee ice cream in a red velvet waffle cone. Everything was really good. Prices weren't too bad, considering they're on the strip. There's usually a long wait so be prepared for that. If you don't want to wait, you can always go around to the side and use their cupcake atm. That's a fun experience. It's a cute little place. The staff is nice and you can get samples of the ice cream. Everything is pretty sweet, but not in a bad way. You may want to get a drink to go with the cupcakes since they have a generous amount of icing on them.",4,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Negative,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Pretty darn good. I have had this place on my bookmarks for awhile. I got a bit lost trying to find the place because I asked the concierge where BOUCHON was and I failed to mention the Bakery. I got sent to the restaurant. It's actually located near the Phantom of Opera show. Right behind the escalators. The french macarons are 3.50 a pop. Well worth it. It's not the best I've had but well worth it. I got the pistachio and chocolate flavors. I loved the pistachio ones. The chocolate ones were okay, very moist and brownie like. I also got the TKO cookie. Eh, didn't really like it. But the macarons are yummy! I need to try more flavors and get out of my comfort zone of just buying pistachio and chocolate.",4,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"UPDATE: I visited Milk bar again and had a better experience. It still seems too expensive but I had the crack pie soft serve with corn flake crunchies this time and it was really yummy!! I also sampled the cereal milk soft serve. It was definitely different than last time. Tasted a lot better! ---- I was really excited to try this. I have watched the chef's table episode about this place and thought it looked so good. Unfortunately it just didn't live up to the hype. The cereal milk soft serve was too cereal-y if that makes sense. I think it should be more subtle. This was the biggest disappointment. I didn't like it very much. Besides that, I DID really like the crack pie and we went back for another the next day. I'm bummed their prices are so high. $6 for a small soft serve? $6.50 for one slice of crack pie?

"Fun, unique desserts if a bit pricey. One night after visiting Secret Pizza we tried the B'Day Milkquake ($10) - this was the better of the items we sampled. It's their Cereal Milk soft serve with birthday cake mixers stirred in. Easily feeds two. This alone will bring me back. On a later visit, we also tried single servings of their birthday cake soft serve ($6) and while good, seemed pricey for what you got and just didn't compare to the B'Day Milkquake. Seating can be a challenge late night (they don't have their own dedicated space) and if you need a sugar fix after visiting Secret Pizza, make sure you pay attention to closing times as Milk Bar closes first.",4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Sweet Republic. It's a place that has been reviewed by tons of different newspapers and magazines. I had to go for a taste. I arrived last evening at the Ice Cream joint. My GPS was slightly off, so for those of you looking to go in the future, just go North on 92nd from Shea. It will be right there. There were a few people in the establishment, but it took less than two minutes for me to be the next in line. Let me tell you, these desserts looked fantastic. The first thing that you see when you get in their ordering line is the Sorbet cabinet. Here is where you will find their delicious sorbets, ranging from exotic fruits to more simple flavors. I, however, was not here for the sorbet. I was here for their ice cream. One of the most amazing things about this place is the innovative flavors they have. Most people prefer to get the Sweet and Salty Caramel Flavor, but I was in the mood for something more adventurous. I ended up getting two scoops, mainly because of the price. One scoop is $2.95, and two scoops is $4.25... At least I can slightly justify paying for the two scoops, so that's what I chose. I chose two of their very fun flavors. The first was their Honey Blue Cheese. Now, for those of you who just got turned off when you saw the flavor, fear not. This ice cream does not taste like the blue cheese that goes on salads. This is a much more creamy, subtle flavor. It tastes like honey, with a little bit of salt. Extremely delicious. I will certainly be having this flavor when I return. The second flavor was, admittedly, much more of a challenge. I got a flavor called White Roses. Can you guess what it tastes like? That's right. Imagine, if you will, smelling a bouquet of roses. Now, imagine biting into it. That is exactly what you will get with this flavor. Now, I suggest that you try it, just to have the experience of tasting it, but I would be weary on purchasing a scoop of it. It's extremely strong, and I was unable to finish it. All in all, it was a great experience. Helpful staff, lots of flavors, and an experience unlike anything other. I fully recommend this ice cream joint to all dessert connoisseurs and sweet tooths alike!",5,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Took MLB to the airport and figured I could use a meal before heading home and this was almost nearly on the way... Not much space between the doors and the pastry case which is great planning in my book; way convenient to get an orange macaron while deciding on snacks. According to legend this is ground zero, the home of the provencal trailer park motif seen and loved by all. Half a Croque Monsieur plus tomato fennel soup and icy water sounded about right. Usually not a fan of the red soup but it's got fennel...! which fixed everything up nicely thank you very much. Hot vermilion soup abounding with flavor, texture, and substance - not the feeble stuff of childhood. My sandwich was superb! a healthy smear of spicy dijon zip complementing the subtle dignity of gruyere on thin sliced hams nestled in a flakey buttery toasted croissant.

The boyfriend had cake batter and he said it was too sweet & he has a HUGE sweet tooth. The only down side is that there was no napkins outside to clean up the ice cream drips. What I don't think people understand who have left 2 or less stars. Where Handel's was started it was about socializing with the neighborhood. You sat on the curb or leaned on cars trying to finish your ice cream before it ran down your arm.

I actually saved half of it for later which was a great idea, since the piece was rather large AND it was a lovely treat to look forward to. Amazing flavor and very moist cake. The icing is ...wowee.

The snowstorms (think DQ's Blizzards) are fantastic, but I always go for 2 dips of either chocolate/lemon or chocolate/orange (recommended to me by an employee). Just remember that regardless of what you get, eat it FAST...or else you'll have a cup of delicious flavored milk.

I also grabbed one of the cookies with chocolate chips, marshmallow, cornflakes, and oats... it was just okay, but I still enjoyed it. My mom and husband weren't very impressed.

"Disclaimer: I am a huge macaron fan. Now that that is out of the air, I LOVE their macarons! These are probably the best macarons I've tasted so far. The only other places I've had them are Vanilla Bakeshop in Santa Monica and Europane in Pasadena. I'm going off on a quest to search for macarons better than these in LA. Bring it! I bought the set of flavors here, and it was totally worth it to try all the flavors! Now I know which ones are my favorite...and they have to be Raspberry, Vanilla Bean, and Coffee. I think these flavors are more fragrant and they coffee has a deep earthy coffee taste to it, just how a coffee flavor should be. The lemon and orange were a little too sweet for me, and I just somehow don't like the citrus flavored macarons as much. And I never had a thing for chocolate flavored anything, so take my opinions with my preferences in mind. The shells are very delicate, as they crack quite easily, but the crunch had just enough soft chew too, and on top of the cream or ganache inside, it was heavenly! I also tried the carrot cake cookie and it was okay. I think the carrot cake could have been more moist. The cream cheese filling was good though. =) There was also a really cute sweets stand next to this stand. Oh, and Bouchon Bakery is not a store. It's literally like a little stand! Downstairs by the casinos and the Phantom of the Opera Theater is where you'll find it. =) And make sure you get there before they close if you want to buy anything. My mom was saying we should go there right before our POTO show started for some dessert after dinner, but I thought that was a huge mistake and made us go in the afternoon before we went outlet shopping and dinner. THANK GOD. It was closed when we came back to watch our show. [Phantom of the Opera was amazing too! But that's beside the point... :)] If you're a macaron fan, definitely try theirs.

By quaint, I mean small, but it is also full to the brim with every sweet piece of candy my childhood nostalgia could remember. While I managed to restrain myself from emptying my bank account on Necco wafers, plastic army men, caramels, rice krispie treats, and local art, I was there for ice cream, and that's exactly what I got. It was a tough choice between a strawberry shortcake sundae and a salted caramel freezie, but in the end I was directed towards the strawberry sundae. It was super creamy, the strawberries were fresh, the whole thing was really flavorful, and there was enough to share (but who does that? Get your own ice cream!), however - and this is my ONLY complaint - I was a little disappointed that the shortcake part of the strawberry shortcake sundae was actually shortbread cookies...not a soft fluffy piece of cake.

"Items Selected: Sausage and Pepperoni Pizza Amaretto Lobster Tail Sfogliatelle Cannoli Lemon Biscotti, Slivered Almond Cookie, Pignoli, Nut Horn, Turtle Cookie, Helen's Date Nut Bar, Raspberry Thumbprint Located at 12101 Mayfield Road, just a few hundred yards from Corbo's and the rest of Cleveland's Little Italy, Presti's Bakery has long been a favorite of neighbors, tourists and Case Western Reserve University students, the family-run space originally founded in 1903 most certainly having withstood tough times, yet still doing great business. Sizable in its selections as well as its seating options, a lack of the latter admittedly a problem at its nearby competitor, entry to Presti's sees diners confronted by nearly one hundred selections both sweet and savory, everything from Pizza and Pasta served as early as 6am with Pastries rolling out all day to replete diminishing favorites. Using an old-school ticketing system, many diners unaware and thus delayed in placing their order at the counter as they are redirected to the red device on a poll, it was after a bit of perusal that most composed an order by way of ever-patient servers, a total of eleven pieces comprised mostly of cookies delivered in boxes and paper trays at the end of a $16 tip and tax inclusive assortment. Approaching 10:30am, essentially lunch hour taking the day's plan as a whole, dining began with a flimsy slice of square Pizza that strongly resembled something from a Highschool cafeteria, even after rewarming, all but a few bites discarded before progressing quickly to the pre-filled Cannoli, the Mascarpone filling smooth and sweet, but the shell already besieged by sogginess. Happy to again see Sfogliatelle, small bits of Fruit giving this iteration a leg up on Corbo's despite a shell that was not quite as springy and shattering, best bites of the meal were found in the lightly Almond scented Lobster Tail piped full of Cream filling, the Date Bar and Pine Nut Pignoli also highly praiseworthy while the Nut Horn and Slivered Almond Cookie each begged for something more than water to combat a texture that was more dry and stale than nutty and crumbly.",2,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Ambiance There are two different stores in one. One area is strictly for cupcakes. The other area is strictly for ice cream. There is a small amount of seating inside in the cupcake part of the store. The ice cream area does not have any seating. However, there are tables outside where one can sit and eat when available. In addition, there is a 24 hour ATM cupcake dispenser outside. Pretty cool item to have if one wants cupcakes. Food Living in the Bay Area, the ice cream is not available in the Palo Alto store. Their sundae where the cupcake and ice cream go together is amazing. Their cupcakes are always super moist and feel like they are freshly baked. Topping that with some good ice cream makes it that much better. Service This place gets pretty packed for ice cream. It can feel slow at times due to the fact that there can be a lot of people in line.

It was topped with apple pie, with the pumpkin pie in the middle and pecan pie as base. Then, there are white cake slices in between. It's heaven in dessert form. The pumpkin was creamy perfection.

"Cool vibe, good coffees and the macaroons are amazing, as are the caramel brownies. However, do NOT buy the cake if you are actually looking for a delicious cake. I ordered the strawberry cream cake which sounds and looks amazing - truly a piece of art, but it's surely not meant to actually be eaten. It's 90% fondant / stiff pastry cream stuff, with zero taste but LOTS of fat. Little channels were dug out and the smallest amount of cake possible was inserted. On top, another stiff greasy fondant pile /swirl topped it off. The ONLY thing strawberry about this 'cake' was a single strawberry, dipped in some glossy gelatinous substance, placed on top, way out of reach of the cake. And it was ~$6.",3,Negative,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"Yet another disappointment on my yelp list for this winter break. I don't know if it was because I came at 9PM for macarons but they were not the best as my friend had promised. I did the buy 5 get 1 free deal for the large ones (the smaller ones would've only cost a dollar less which made me ??? oh well) and got eggnog, salted caramel, pistachio, chocolate, and raspberry. Out of all the flavors, salted caramel was definitely the best, then pistachio, chocolate, raspberry, and eggnog. All of the macarons were too crunchy for my liking. The shells were slightly dried out and didn't have the chewiness I like biting into. And the flavors themselves weren't that vibrant. I didn't feel like I got the pure taste of each flavor in the macarons sadly. Honestly such a let down but what saved the trip to Bouchon for me was the chocolate almond croissant. I never thought I could like a croissant so much, but this one hit the spot. Even though it took me a full 5 days to finish the croissant, I thoroughly enjoyed every chocolatey bite and correct me if I'm wrong but I think there was also a spread of coconut in between the flakey buttery layers. The croissant didn't go stale and tasted a million times better lightly toasted in the convection oven. So definitely come here for the chocolate almond croissant. Maybe swing by earlier in the day for fresher macarons? But my past macaron experiences have been much better than Bouchon (they tasted way better and lasted a lot longer) so take caution before you shell out about $3 a cookie.",3,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"I was looking to try some boba in the area, and I thought that I would stop by here. The store is clean and the workers are super friendly + knowledgeable! I had a sample of the strawberry jasmine tea, which was really delicious but way too sweet for me. I ordered a jasmine milk tea with boba at a level of 25% sugar. I was disappointed that they didn't offer 0% sugar, but I learned that the drinks were premade so they're unable to adjust the sweetness level below a certain threshold for certain drinks (I think the coffee drinks are the only ones that can be adjusted down to 0% sugar). Presumably because the milk tea was premade, my drink came out really fast! My drink was okay, I'm just not a fan of sugar in my tea, which is why I docked my review to 3 stars. I would rather go to another shop for boba, but I would come back to try the ice cream!",3,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown
"Was in Sloans about a week ago. Laura was very patient, she talked to me about every single ice cream, spoke about the fudge like it was her passion. She knows her stuff and has a lot of positive energy. Her attitude was so amazing I wanted to let her manager know, I asked Laura if she could get her manager, and when she went to check if she was there she said her manager said that ""she was not clocked in and busy."" As a former business owner/manager I see that as a lack in work ethic on the managers end. I felt a little more than disappointed when the manager refused to talk to me about a great employee. However, I will not give this post less than 5 stars because of the managers unwillingness to talk to a customer.

"I was there at the grand opening at 9. got there around 8:00am and was one of the first 25 people . They had UNLV cheerleaders to cheer and had a great opening. The bread was nice and fresh. Respect for the managers to have crowd control and not let it look like a Hong Kong protest inside with people grabbing bread off the trays before they hit the shelf. They handled that pretty well. I got everything I could on my tray. two mugs and the yardstick for the first 100 customers. The above review is 5 stars worthy for the morning. the reason why I put a one star is for people who are curious and for the managers to look at how they did cause they care about the business and need customer feedback. I went back there at night because I gave most of the bread pastries away to my coworkers since we had a birthday celebration. I did not have a chance to try the matcha custard bread, milk pudding bun, the croquette bun. etc. I went back hoping there was still more at night. instead it was mostly subpar items like muffins and the egg tarts. None of the premium items I saw in the morning or mentioned above or the ones you see in the morning review posts. It was just pumping out the same bread and put it in three different places. I saw the berry tart like in three different shelves and muffins that anyone can go get at Starbucks. It was just selling bread at that point for profit since there was a demand there, but also because they probably ran out of ingredients for the other items. Here is the reason where they screwed up. Since the morning. it was pretty chaotic with all the excitement. I forgot to ask if the free yardstick was refillable or not. I heard the regional divisional manager say this is the first of its kind for Las Vegas since it has Vegas themes on the free items. I could not hear if he said ""free"" refills or "" no refills for the yardstick. I went back at night to ask and clarify. I asked three employees and they did not know. Till I asked the lady at the drink section kindly if it was free refill or not. The cashier next to her heard me and said in an angry tone. NO REFILL. then mumbled to her coworker "" they brought it up in the meeting."" the one I asked kindly went to her manager and asked and she came back and told me no without yelling No REFILL like the other cashier did. I accepted it since i wasnt sure due to all the noise in the morning. The one star is for the rude cashier at the front. All it takes is one thing to ruin the whole experience. the customers are the driving force for the business, but if they have cashiers not able to handle the customers, then people reading should be aware to expect it. Bread was perfect, grand opening was perfect. Ask a question and get an angry response from another employee and I am willing to spend the time to write this one star review. Do yourself a favor. Dont go there at night and grab the leftover inventory.

Nestled right in the heart of downtown, it's a perfect spot for everyone be it college or corporate! The ice cream options are quite the handful and extremely fun as they mostly stay away from the bog standard usual's (Vanilla, Chocolate etc). Take your sweet time to read the descriptionS carefully coz many of them are delightful concoctions with interesting flavor twists! I tried their Strawberry Cheesecake and Zanzibar and man o man both rocked! It was soo nice to have a ""cheesecake"" ice cream with LOTS of cheesecake in it! The strawberry flavor was nice and not overly sweet and complimented the cheesecake bites. The Zanzibar was a medley of chocolate flavors and the result was this very rich but not dense chocolate taste with a hint of brownie after taste to it. Texture of both ice cream was pleasantly gooey which I much rather prefer than hard or custardy Ala yogurt. My only critique I'd say would be the presence of icy crystals in both the ice creams. They weren't that many but do mar the otherwise exquisite experience.

Think about it - RAMEN & ICE CREAM! How awesome is that?! The owners are some of the coolest people you'll encounter here in Cleveland! They greet you and offer samples of everything!

"Seriously? Am I really seeing this? I have reached PMS nirvana. This Francophile has found sweet gastronomic heaven. My dear friend/fellow food/shoe/book junkie and I popped our Amelie's cherry(tart) late on Friday night and were pleasantly surprised by the high energy, efficiency of the staff (they kept that line mooooving!), funky decor and sinful eye candy. We had ourselves a little sampling and here's the good, the bad and the ugly: Good: Creme Puffs filled with rich, sweet, thick custard. No wimpy whipped cream here. My toes curled. The Salted Caramel Brownie. If I'd been w/anyone other than her, they would've been gotten stabbed in the hand w/my fork had they tried to sample this gooey confection. There is close to 1/4 inch of caramel atop this chewey brownie and the addition of a pinch of salt saves this from being too sweet. The Tea Cakes are very moist. The raspberry has a stronger flavor than the lemon. The line moves quickly. The bad: Okay, it really wasn't bad, but my hubby and I tried the Petit Gateau and, while the gnache was rich and smooth (just how I like my men, lol) the cake was actually pretty dry. The line moves so fast, you may not have a chance to see all the goodies. I like to weigh my options; calories are precious and I can't waste'em on so-so snacks. Lotsa empty trays. No matter how fast they work, they can't keep up w/demand so it seems like we may have missed some good options. The Ugly: The near cat-fight over the last eclairs and the creepy mannequin that literally leans over your shoulder as you wait in line. I'm a Leo, I like my space and crazy as it sounds, that thing was giving me the heebies.

We arrived at 9:30, which seems like plenty of time to order and eat before the 10pm closing time. We waited for 20 minutes for them to make the split. After having served the 2 groups that had ordered after us, we started to watch the 3 workers behind the counter to see if they were making our split. This is when we noticed they were standing there chatting (not working) about their social lives. Not a huge deal to be served after but when they finally made our split, what they presented us with was a Banana Split in 4 different containers for us to take with us. WHAT???? When I inquired why it was package to go, I was informed that since they close at 10 and dont get paid to stay after. Keep in mind it was still 9:50. Since, we are in a hotel on vacation, I could not drive the 20 minutes back and eat it out of 4 containers in my room.

"First time at Jenni's, ordered 1/2 scoop of the rosÃ© sorbert and the coffee with cream and sugar in a cup ($6). I really enjoyed both flavors I didn't get to try their cones. I like the rosÃ© sorbert over the coffee flavor more. They have no restrooms but they have plenty of outdoor seating. The building is super cute and there is a mural around the corner from the ice cream shop. It's in a really nice gentrified area of Charlotte with a lot of other restaurants and shops nearby. I parked maybe a block away and paid $5 there is also street parking. Last Sunday when the temperature was really hot- on a winter day the line was out the door. Make sure you get there early if you don't want to wait a long time. The workers were pleasant. They do have free stickers if you have a little one or just like to collect stickers.",4,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive
"I missed the Milk Bar Yelp event and was surprised by the low ratings when this business opened, so I had to check it out myself. I have very mixed feelings about how to rate this place because some of the reviews are nitpicky as hell (but they bring up a lot of valid points), but the product is pretty good. Worth the Strip price-hike though? Debatable. LOCATION: Inside the Cosmo, easily accessible from the parking garage. Walkup counter, no dedicated seating, Chandelier Bar has couches and Eggslut has counter seating nearby. Other locations are walkup only, so this shouldn't be an issue. But a lot of people dislike it. PRICING: Compared to NYC locations, prices are a bit higher (+75c per cookie, +$1 for Crack Pie Slice, +$1.50 soft serve, +$3 for greatest hits combo, etc.). Similarly, their Milk Quakes are $12 compared to other alcoholic shake options nearby that are $15. But the other place has larger portions and great presentation, too. SERVICE: Fine. No complaints. My order was taken by friendly staff. I waited on one of my items for a few minutes and a staff member asked what I was waiting on, noticed it had been forgotten, and made it immediately. PRODUCT: Sampled a little bit of everything with the Greatest Hits Combo ($19). There are also mixes, cookbooks, tote bags, scarves, and such available for gifting. Cereal Milk Soft Serve- other reviews say the flavor is bland and portion is small, but I could barely eat half of it. I'm not a corn flake fan but the texture was appreciated and enhanced the flavor, which had a nice pinch of saltiness to it like you really get at the bottom of a bowl. Compost Cookie- #nocrunchycookies! This had the perfect texture of soft and chewy, but not falling apart. Interesting combination of flavors but I can't really say I liked it. Maybe I'll try other cookie flavors in the future, but the NYC price is a lot more appealing. Birthday Truffles- I couldn't decide if I liked this. Nice hint of bday cake flavor but really sweet. Only ate one of the pack of three and that was enough. This might be fun for gifting though. Crack Pie- It's like pecan pie without the pecans and I like that it isn't too sweet but I'm not about to get addicted. As others have said, the slice is tiny. For the price, it should be deeper/taller. It's a nice little treat but the cardboard sleeve packaging preventing you from seeing the portion size is a bit deceptive. Birthday Cake!- Okay, full disclosure, I got the cake free through an IG promo. The 6"" regularly retails for $56. The portion claims to feed 8-12, and I'd say that's accurate. It's fairly tasty and not too sweet, and I like how the crumbles add texture. The ""naked"" decoration style also keeps the ratio of cake to frosting more even, and the multiple layers are both pretty and help to distribute the frosting. Would I eat it again? Probably. Would I pay nearly $60 for this cake? Probably not. Unclear why the crack pie is available whole or sliced but their self-proclaimed ""fan favorite"" cake is not. In short, it's A-OK. It's exciting that we have a Milk Bar location on the West coast and I'm glad I tried it, but even if I happen to be at the Cosmo, it's not a must-go place for me. Even if there isn't a line.",3,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown
"Hype little ice cream spot. Definitely a vibe, throwback cereal interior gives you that nostalgia. My friend got the bowl, Cosmo & Wanda--fruit loops and captain crunch all berries with almond milk and ice cream haha, she loaded up, that was actually legit though because the almond milk almost made it sweeter if you can imagine that. Perfect Combo I went with a shake and got Mucha Lucha it was the perfect little mix basically a hella sweet horchata milkshake, perfect cinnamon sugar balance. We both enjoyed it so much. They were very considerate when helping move the line as quick as they could, paying attention to detail. I think we had to switch something last minute but they were great with communicating to us and quick to make fixes and pivot. They were definitely using gloves and all that so it felt very clean and just well run.

"Such wonderful ice cream!! The texture is joyously creamy and the flavors are rich and encompass the standards and many creative ones -- like orange blossom (outstanding!) and honey graham -- all at excellent prices. The staff is patient and friendly. There's plenty of outdoor seating; there's no indoor seating as this is a large ice cream stand, but much of the seating is under an awning. My only complaint is that oddly -- although like other places I've seen around Cleveland -- it looks like only a few flavors can be used for milkshakes (and I keep forgetting to ask why that is), which is too bad as many of the other flavors would make incredible milkshakes.",5,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive
Yum! So good! I got this recommendation from a blog on pinterest and it was worth it! Its a small little shop with a lot of different ice cream options and a bunch of candy. They make their own marshmallow creme which is mostly why I wanted to go there. Its my favorite ice cream topping. We got the smores sundae to share and it was huge and really good. She put a big scoop of marshmallow creme on it and the torched it. I usually like it more hot and melted like a syrup but this was good too. The service was great.

"Dichotomy What?!? What is that? How do you pronounce it? I don't know, but what I do know is that this was my favorite out of all the flavors they had out (for sample) I tried a couple and I was wowwed. It was sweet and had a hint of saltiness. I thought I wasn't a big fan of mixing sweet and salty but I guess I was wrong. They have a whole variety full of flavors but that one was the one that stuck with me. I live in NYC (I was in Cleveland for a friend's wedding last weekend) I wished I could have gotten more bags of popcorn but thank goodness to technology, I can order bags of popcorn from their website. My only question is, how big are the bags. They have a 12ct bag box for $33.

"Old fashioned, hand dipped ice cream will forever be a bringer of joy. My first official job was at an old school ice cream shoppe in York, PA, where I worked for four years along with other jobs until my studies conflicted with my work schedule. It was the best job I have ever had. This job taught me the value of a dollar, and how having a passion for service results in more money and a feeling of self-fulfillment. My parents liked it because they had a never ending supply of ice cream in their freezer. ""Don't come home unless you have a hot fudge sundae."" Yes, Dad. So many great things have already been said about Churn, so I will just reiterate what has already been said. Churn rocks! Grab one of their awesome delicacies and enjoy them on their patio seating in the rear of the building. I particularly love the S'mores sundae--it's huge, the graham crackers are fresh, and the butane torched marshmallow is its cherry on top, so to speak. It sucks there's only valet, but I'm glad there's parking nonetheless. The service was exceptionally friendly, and the gentleman behind the counter told me I could sample anything I wanted.

"I was first introduced to Milk Bar after trying out their truffles in a gift box and loved the whole concept and packaging. The truffles were a little too sweet for me, so I was hoping the cereal soft serve would be better - and it was! The soft serve tastes EXACTLY like what you would imagine cereal milk in ice cream form would taste like. It wasn't overly sweet, and I liked that the cereal topping (extra $1) provided a nice crunch which complemented the soft, creamy ice cream. I do wish that the cereal topping was less salty. I don't know what they do to it, but it would taste so much better if they left it plain and simple - crunchy, corn flakes. Don't salt the cereal guys! I cannot give this place a full 4 stars simply because of the price.

I've been to the one in NYC two years ago and was hoping that this would be a slightly different experience, but it's the same stuff, which is great if you enjoy it. Cornflake crunch is so salty that we scooped ice cream off around it. Cereal milk one just tastes like salty cereal milk ice cream. Fruity cereal was more palatable but certainly not worth $7.50 (one topping) plus tax. Their crack pie just isn't appealing at all to me, but they have plenty of other cookie options, so maybe you'll find one you like while searching for something to satisfy your sweet tooth.",3,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

Their staff are very friendly and when this place gets long lines during warm weather, they handle it like pros and get people through so you're enjoying your ice cream desires in no time. Their prices are very reasonable, and at this location you can rent out the second floor for a private party. Their rainbow sprinkles are awesome and plentiful. What they're great at are the fun flavors they think of. Anything that you see that has chunks in it (e.g. cookies and cream) has the perfect amount, very generous.

The cake was *very dry* like stale bread on the bottom, like it had been sitting out for a long time on the plate or something, despite being told it was freshly cut. And the overall quality of the cake was sub-par/ not a treat to enjoy. Also, because of the other reviews raving about this spot as a cake spot, I was very disappointed in the selection of cakes, only a handful (4 or 5) to choose from. One slice will set you back about $7-8 dollars (with a tip.. $6.50 each) which is fine if it tasted good. But no. Cake should not be dry flavorless bread. Don't serve stale stuff. It leaves a bad taste in your customer's mouth (literally -- no one likes to be ripped off). Underwhelming experience. Also, a suggestion for an actual menu either on paper or posted somewhere, so customers can get an idea of the types of beverages the place offers would help. Needs improvements in quality of service, selections, and quality of the products.",1,Negative,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"Whether you are first time visiting the UW-Madison or repeated visitors, enjoy scoops of the UW-Madison home-made ice cream is a must. There are three locations: Memorial Union, Union South, and Babcock Dairy Store at 1605 Linden Drive, Madison, WI 53706. Each place has different hours, so be sure you double check before heading over. The Memorial Union store has more flavors including new flavors they are piloting. All three locations carry popular flavors. All flavors are decent, pick what you like. Orange Custard Chocolate Chip is a unique flavor that you won't find elsewhere and has been around for more than 30 years. Good portion with reasonable price. Great quality ice cream. For example, someone I knew had three large scoops all at once one time, did not feel any discomfort from lactose intolerance. The staff were courteous and efficient. The store well organized. There were ice cream drips near the payment area, the staff there did not seem to notice. Would be great to pay attention on payment areas to ensure cleanness, which makes making payments easier. Two drawback is that you are not able to sample it as COVID restrictions is still on. Unlike some specialty ice cream stores, you are not able to get one scoop with 2-3 different flavors. Seems like the Memorial Union location also have shortened hours during wintertime where it opens at 2pm on weekdays.",5,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

It was pricey though for two soft serves it was $14 so about $7 each ice cream with out the cone.

I was without a doubt made to feel better by her benevolence as well as the incredible flavors of the S'mores ice cream sundae I indulged in. I paired it with chocolate and peanut butter (but probably should have gone with the vanilla that she recommended due to chocolate overload). I'm not a fan of marshmallows, but it seems they make them there (or have a magical vendor) and let me tell you...it was delicious as was the entire concoction!

I did think the prices were high though. However, I thought I would get some things to try (see if they were worth the price). I ordered an eclair ($2.50 and it was very small), 2 peanut butter cookies ($1.95 each) and an individual red velvet cake ($9.95 which is way overpriced for one small cake). In my opinion I don't think they were worth the money. With those prices I expected it to be absolutely amazing. They weren't bad, I've just had better else where at half the cost.

Well, Amelie's was definitely 5-stars both times and I can definitely see this place being my new late night Crown Town hang out! First off, this place is like a museum with all sorts of weird, quirky, and fun decor! The back room especially feels like the living room of a close friend if they were a hip hoarder of chic, contemporary, and collectible french-themed tchotchkes. Second, their menu is just stellar and oddly not that overpriced, especially for the NoDa area. Third, they are open 24/7! Recently, I was locked out of my place and had to find somewhere to chill from 4:30am-7am...Amelies to the rescue! Not only did I have the comfy couch all to myself, but I curled up on it w/my phone connected to their free wifi and easily killed 2.5hrs into the dawn w/a delectable lavender coconut creme cafe and bacon brie tartine. The staff can be a little hit or miss, but for the most part, they are friendly and informative if you have a question about a menu item. Service is counter and they will give you a number to bring your food items out to you, but you pick up any coffee/tea orders at the counter. They do have a separate place to order from the bakery/pastry case (haven't tried anything from there yet because I am afraid to unleash that beast, but it will probably happen on my next visit). Their bfast croissant are fantastic and their shot in the dark (drip + espresso shot) passed my palate.

Loved the chocolate, but the PB was not my fave, should've gotten the Vietnamese coffee. It was also a hot day and with no seating inside, we sat on the patio and raced against the clock eating our melty treats.

"I would leave 5 stars if I could, but since my friend pre-ordered two dozen and picked up for me I cannot comment on the physical location or the staff. I can say that my friend had no issues placing his the order or picking it up in the morning. Forgive me for not knowing exact amounts but there were a lot of the matcha green tea cake donuts, several blueberry lemon cake donuts, and some raspberry pistachio yeast donuts. I was most excited for the matcha donuts because I'm obsessed with matcha. This donut was an absolute success, it made the perfect cake donut. It was sweet but not overly so and the matcha flavor was prominent without being overbearing. I loved the texture of it as a cake donut, definitely could have eaten twenty more of these. I then tried the raspberry pistachio yeast donut which was as big as my face. Seriously, the thing was HUGE! I'm generally not a fan of yeast donuts because they lack flavor, this yeast donut however had the perfect fluffy texture and was buttery. the raspberry pistachio icing was incredible as well, slightly tart but mostly sweet with subtle hints of pistachio. It melted in my mouth with each bite, I was sad but very full when it was all over. I really want to go back to try their creme brÃ»lÃ©e donut, as well as any others they're offering. I'm reading reviews about their donuts being dry but I didn't have that experience at all. I think Donut Bar's donuts are way better than the donuts O-Face used to sell.

The Italian cheesecake is perfect. it is not expensive at all. The cannoli is not as amazing as the cheesecake but it is ok too.

"We went last week and waited in line about an hour. The employee at the front of the line only let's in a few at a time and tells you to go to the front. I walked to the front counter but that wasn't where she wanted me to go, where she wanted me to go was to the end of the counter closest to the hall where I'd just come in from, sorry but that's not the front. Once you stand there someone will come over and take your order but you can't really see everything without walking around first unless you are psychic and know what's in the cases. The small tiny one person sized dessert cakes are way overpriced at either 7.95 or 9.95 each depending on which one you got. I love cannolis but theirs was too hard and crunchy and the filling was ok nothing worth the wait. My fave cookie is the black and white and my fave place to get one is still the deli at the south point hotel, the one here just plain wasn't good. Frosting was okay but cookie itself not good. For the prices I expect much better quality. They were also giving away samples of what I was told was a butter cookie but it wasn't even close to being as good as a walkers shortbread. I took one bite and threw rest away. Ivebhad better from keebler and nabisco.I don't know if buddy has gotten to big for his britches and lost sight of quality control or if they have always been about par and perhaps the people of new jersey just never had anything good to compare it against.

We stayed at the Venetian, and their pop up bakery right when you exit the guest elevators is where the bakery was, and the lines are always long. Worth every minute.

Thankfully we found Melt! Melt is such a cute little place, but it does its job. They sell drinks, candy, mangonadas and serves extra delicious ice cream. The packaging is so cute too, it comes in little Chinese take out boxes and includes a fortune cookie. My sister and I each got a single scoop, Cookie Monster and a Cute-cumber. Our total came out to $9.00 even. Single scoops are $4.50, double scoops are $6.00 and triple scoops are $7.50. Cookie Monster was the perfect amount of sweet and chewy from the cookie and cookie dough. Cute-cumber was a refreshing, very light, less sweet option. We both enjoyed our ice creams very much. I really like that they have a lot of different and seasonal flavors, some like zombie brains, pumpkin pie and churro. They do have a roomy outside area to sit and enjoy, none inside. They have tea lights and benches that create such a cozy ambiance. I like it here, and I can't wait to come back to try new/changing/seasonal flavors!

"I was quite happy when Batch opened. It's down the street from my house, so nearly every day I've walked past it and stared at the kitchen window where people are baking. It always looked so delicious! However, I'm not sure if I haven't tried the right items yet, or if I'm just picky about bread, because both the baguette and the croissant were just mediocre. It's definitely good quality compared to the average bread I get at Madison restaurants, but it doesn't come close to the baked goods at Sophia's (<a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz/sophias-bakery-and-cafe-madison"">yelp.com/biz/sophias-bak¦</a>) or loaves of bread from Madison Sourdough (<a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz/madison-sourdough-company-inc-madison"">yelp.com/biz/madison-sou¦</a>). Specifically, the bread didn't really taste like anything. I would think it hadn't been given enough time to rest and develop flavor through longer fermentation, or like they hadn't started with a poolish (starter). Texturally, the baguette was too fluffy and uniform inside, with no little air pockets or visible strands of gluten structure. The flavor of the croissant was good, but the texture seemed too dense and packed together, like the butter hadn't broken through the layers the way it is supposed to. I would also suggest a little less marzipan inside the almond croissant - it was a bit too sweet. I enjoyed their fougasse, which is a little bit like a focaccia. Given the weaknesses with their dough, this makes sense, since a fougasse has a fair amount of oil and herbs that can cover up a flavorless dough. Maybe I was there on an off day, or maybe I haven't tried the right items. I'll certainly be back another time or two, but I'm keeping my expectations lower next time.",2,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

The macarons are delicious. The blueberry croissants were interesting, but not as good. Very tart and too much filling so it made it mushy. The Kouign Amann is good too.

I don't think I would ever go out of my way to eat here again, but it was decent. My fiancÃ© HATED it. After one bite he begged me for a stick of gum and kept making faces.

"I'm going to give helpful instructions to the Counter Help. If there are two customers waiting for help, and there are three of you behind the counter, and one goes to help the first customer, then one of the remaining two should assist the remaining customer. You should not be standing behind the counter talking. I don't care how compelling the story is you are listening to, or telling, you are in a retail bakery; you have a customer waiting: WAIT ON THEM. Is that really so hard? And doing a ""yoo-hoo!!"" at me after I turn to leave in disgust? Sorry, you've already lost the sale. Try to preserve some of your dignity. The chocolate croissant and ginger cookie I bought down the street, after leaving, at Madison Sourdough were delicious.

The chocolate hazelnut biscotti and chocolate almond biscotti are fantastic. Great cream puffs also. I will definitely stop there whenever I'm in town.

"I'm so happy to see that there's finally an 85C Bakery here in LV! My fiancÃ© and I had our first taste of their baked goods whenever we travelled to SoCal. The pastries were so tasty that we always made sure to bring some back home with us. We tried to stop in one night when they first opened and there was a huge line that was nearly out the door. So after that, we decided to wait till the crowds died down. We finally stopped in this morning and the bakery wasn't crowded at all. I definitely recommend stopping by in the morning when it's not super packed. This bakery is arranged as a grab and go. Once you walk in, simply grab a tray, liner, and tongs and start grabbing any of the baked goods you want. When you're done, just pay in the front with one of the cashiers and they'll bag it for you. It's super easy and quick! They have a large selection of sweet and savory items to choose from. Some of our favorites were the sausage roll, milk custard bun, and mango custard bun. We even picked up a package of coconut snow cubes in the refrigerated section of the bakery, which was pretty good. In addition, they have a display of other sweet treats (such as cakes, tarts, cookies, etc) and milk tea/coffee. We haven't tried any of their drinks yet but it's definitely on our list to try next time. This place is a wonderful addition to LV. With the friendly service and delicious pastries, we will be sure to come back again and again.",5,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Negative,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown

Favorite flavors include - Wild Berry Crumble, Butter Pecan, Toasted Pistachio and Praline Pecan.

Dough has a good balance of fluffy, bready and chewy, these are just bready. TBH they kinda taste grocery store esque with more unique flavors (not that grocery store donuts are all that bad...just ""standard"") I've tried a lot of donuts ever since moving to Las Vegas and so far these have been at the bottom of the list...I'd rather wait for the red sign to go on at Krispy Kreme.

"We finally took the endeavor to the Boardwalk to try Ninety's. I love the concept of this place: sandwiches and novelty ice cream stuff. First, for a Sunday evening, I was shocked at how packed it was- the line was out the door. Wasn't sure if this was a staffing issue or if t just took forever to make the orders. The line moved at an ok pace. Second of all, and I feel like this was glaring... THEY WERE NOT PLAYING ANY 90s MUSIC!!!! Also no 90s decor whatsoever. For a #beninetiescool they kind of drop the ball on that. The sandwich menu (which should be placed on the incoming side of the line instead of the far end) were all 90s themed names, so they committed there. But I'm not sure why that was the extent of the theme. The rest of the decor was lacking too. They had valentine's day decorations up which was nice. But low tile ceiling and tile floors made it feel cramped. As far as the actual food... - Reuben: not too bad. Nice and warm, great thousand island sauce. - Ice cream shake: got the choco lotta coconut. Was hoping it would have more of the caramel, coconut and shortbread cookies mixed in. Also, the ice cream was Hershey's. I'm not against it, but it was just average. - Yummee Buns: okay these were DELICIOUS. Perfect hunny buns, and the perfect amount of toppings and ice cream. These are basically ice cream sandwiches with a hunny bun as the outer part. We got the OG (vanilla with strawberry shortcake spread and sprinkles) and the peanut butter chocolate one with chocolate ice cream and Reese's. Both delicious!!! - Ice cream macaroons: also pretty good. The macaroons were perfect. Again I wish the ice cream was a little better than Hershey's, but the toppings were nice. I didn't get these, but I did have a bite. So 3 stars due to long line and lack of decor (really selling themselves short on this- could be an easy fix). The sandwiches were pretty good, and the desserts were good, but had a little to be desired. I would definitely drive up there again just for a Yummee Bun again though!!!",3,Positive,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Negative,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown

Sometimes i like to pair it with the chocolate peanut butter cup ice cream. This location is where they make their ice cream, and you get the joy of watching them make it if you see fit.

"Road Trip Summer 2016 I'm cheap when it comes to shoes and purses, but with pastries I'm a freakin' baller. I LOVE breads and desserts from Bouchon, that's where I'd spend my dollar dollar bill, y'all! In this review, I'm going to focus on their macarons, the French sandwich cookie (NOT macarOOns, the cookies with coconut). I get irritated when people label their cookie pics incorrectly. It's hard to resist macarons, airy and delicately crisp, so I bought a box of six minis and six large ones (buy 5, get one free). I love the sweet, creamy filling but their flavors were not very exciting - vanilla, chocolate, pistachio, salted caramel, raspberry. How about matcha tea? Blueberry? Black Sesame? Or how about Champagne? They need more colorful macarons!Nevertheless, I enjoyed the French cookies but I don't need to get two boxes next time. I'd rather stock up on the breads.

After a fun ride on the High Roller we walked back through the Linq heading back to Las Vegas Blvd and what did we happen to see? Sprinkles! We decided that all of a sudden nothing sounded better than a cupcake so we went inside. There was a long line but lucky for us it was for their ice cream and not their cupcakes. We made out decisions, purchased, and sat outside to enjoy our cupcakes. Since it was Halloween/Fall they had a delicious looking caramel apple cupcake so that is what i had. It was good but nothing close to the best cupcake I have ever had. My friends felt the same about their banana and vanilla cupcakes. One of the coolest things I have ever seen was their cupcake ATM. Yes, it really is an ATM that dispenses cupcakes instead of cash. I rather have cash but cupcakes are a close second.

"I'v been watching Cake Boss for years now and after my experiences at Carlo's Bake Shop I have come to the conclusion that Buddy and the Bakery is a case of a TV show making things look way better than they actually are. One thing I noticed from the show is that Buddy excels at making Cakes LOOK amazing but have you noticed everything is produced from sheet cake? There's no real skill at baking a sheet cake, even my 4 year old Niece can do that. Visiting on a Tuesday evening the Bakery wasn't as busy as I expected so if you don't want to wait long this is the time to come!

"Best cookies ever! I first tried them when my friend brought them back for me from NYC. When I found out there was a location in Vegas inside the Cosmopolitan hotel, I knew I had to make a detour and get more. All of the cookies are excellent, but my favorite is the compost cookie. Aside from the cookies, I've also tried the birthday cake, which tastes exactly how you'd imagine - like the nostalgic boxed funfetti cake, but better. I've also had the milk-flavored soft serve they're famous for, which isn't my favorite. It tastes exactly like milk, with minimal sweetness. I'd recommend the crack pie soft serve with cornflake topping - the saltiness of the cornflakes works well with the ultra-sweet soft serve.",5,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"My husband and I got shut out of trying one of the boozy shakes at Holsteins next door because the bar was so crowded so we decided to give Milk Bar a try instead. Their boozy shakes did not compare. In fact, the alcohol to chocolate ratio was a bit too strong to be enjoyable. We also ordered a chocolate chip cookie, corn cookie, and a slice of crack pie (because apparently that's the thing to get here). The cookies were yummy but not mind blowing. The crack pie was pretty disappointing. It was a cold, chewy pie slice of sugar. I would go back to try their ice cream or for a quick cookie fix, but everything else here was pretty average or underwhelming.",4,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Being a huge fan of Christina Tosi I was beyond excited to try Milk Bar. I was sadly disappointed. I got a slice of birthday cake, birthday cake truffles, a corn cookie and a slice of crack pie. The birthday cake was my least favorite. The icing had a weird lemon like flavor. The birthday cake truffles were sandy in texture, tasted like a birthday cake pop from Starbucks, but the chocolate replaced with sand. The corn cookie was extremely salty. Like someone replaced the sugar with salt. And the crack pie was alright. It was super sweet and hard to eat more than one bite. It tasted like pecan pie without the pecans.

"What to get: pastries, salted caramel mocha Service: 4/5 Atmosphere: cafe, study or meet up spot Wait: 10 mins (Saturday 8PM for 1) Parking: shared parking lot The Experience: It was around the end of my solo trip and though it's easy to secure a spot most places for one, Charlotte on a Saturday night gets crowded no matter where you go. At least all the well-known places do. So tired of potentially waiting for 30+ mins for even a spot at a bar, I headed over to Amelie's to have dessert for dinner. This particular location is in a strip mall with multiple businesses, so it's a large, shared parking lot. Biggest perk is that this place is open 24 hrs. Therefore, I can see it as a great place for studying late nights or getting together to meet up and chat with friends. To order, you'll likely line up by the counter, but it moves constantly. A lot of their pastries looked great. I tried a fruit tart and multiple flavors of macarons. The flavors of macarons weren't posted, so I just picked based on color. The cookies are actually pretty fluffy and moist, even after a day or so. The tart was fine, but nothing particularly special. Their salted caramel mocha latte(?) was actually the highlight for me. I'm always up for anything different they have on their coffee drinks menu and this one was well balanced. Mellow and slightly sweet, which made it easy to have with or without any treats to along with it. Pretty cute spot and a nice haven to get away from the crowds at dinner time.",4,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown
"I've been a Jeni's fan for a long time, I used to get it a lot when I lived in Chicago so I was stoked when they opened one in CLT right after I moved here. As with other locations, the inside is bright and inviting and they have awesome flavors. Really I have yet to try a bad one but my favorites recently are the gooey butter cake and cream puff. The cream puff might actually be my favorite ice cream of all time. This location can get busy but the line moves quickly. The staff are friendly and happy to let you try any flavors. I know people think Jeni's is expensive but nowadays, I feel like any quality ice cream is. I also think the Jeni's portions are very generous, so that helps with the price. I always get the ""standard"" 2 half scoops for $5 and honestly it's enough that I could share it with my husband instead of each getting our own cone (but where's the fun in that, right?). There's a lot of street parking around this location and it's the perfect spot to grab an ice cream and walk around.",5,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown

"When you walk into the front of the Venetian, you will need to walk all the way through to the back of the casino to find this, and it's under and escalator. I expected a cute cafe vibe, but it's just a counter that you walk up to and order from. There's no seating so we ate our pastries at the food court. Lots of pastries, a few different coffee selections. I had an iced latte with nonfat milk and vanilla, which was pretty good! My group shared an almond croissant, a chocolate almond croissant, and a pain au chocolat. The pain au chocolat was definitely the best. The chocolate almond croissant was so dry it's likely it was not fresh and perhaps stale. I prefer a very soft, buttery croissant and this was not that. You have to ask them to warm them for you, which we didn't know. Warming it would've improved the taste, but oh well.

"This bakery is 24 hours, and that is deserving of major brownie points. I think they also bake brownies. The breakfast offerings go beyond your standard muffin and croissants, and they have a very eclectic menu. I must say that I cannot imagine who would be willing to drive to this possible late-night eatery. There are bars about a mile down the road, but to drive here to have a drunken meal of muffins and bread is beyond me! I went with the mushroom duxelle tartine. I have not had too much MD in my day, so it was nice having something different than your standard biscuits and gravy in the South, though I assure you Amelie's could whip up a mean B&G. The open-faced fungus sandwich was awesome. The spread was rich and buttery and tasted exactly how roasted mushrooms should taste. The crusty warm bread on the bottom was the perfect canvas. Not much else can be said besides that the $4 tag is a great price to pay.

"I used to sell Honey on the black market, and I got a good share of the profits (that was my Honey Cut), but I got sick of it (I was in a Honey Rut), so I opened a Crazy Golf course (named Honey Putt). One of my customers became the love of my life... we had nicknames for each other (she was Honey Butt) (I was Honey Nuts), and all was going well until we went bankrupt (Honey Kaput). So we started making adult movies together, and opened our own production company (Honey Smut), and it went so well that we were able to use the earnings to tour the country in search of the best Honey Pecan Ice Cream imaginable. And we found it. And it's in Cleveland. (drops mic) What to get: Honey Pecan Ice Cream Why: Because Honey Butt agrees, it's the best in the country Your dog won't like this ice cream, unless it's a Pecanese. If you close you're eyes, I'll hide your ice cream and we can see if you find it. Count to 40! No Pecan! The funny thing is, I don't even like Honey Pecan ice cream, mainly because I'm not crazy about nuts, but this thing is so good that I don't care - and you won't either. It's always busy here and the Honey Pecan is the reason why. There are several other locations in the area too, but this one is my favourite because it seems like all the cute customers hang out here, not to mention the girl that served me was a total flirt and while I am completely immune to such things... OK fine I'm not immune at all and I loved it. I need to pee and the only thing around is a can. I guess now it's a Peecan. Cleveland has a lot of wonderful places to eat main meals and snacks, but when it comes to dessert treats, you come here for ice cream, and then you go to Biagio's at 4am and get hot-out-of-the-fryer Crulers. And if the cute people here aren't enough for you and you're looking more for Playboy types, go to ""Bunny Hut."" If you want to date a comedian (like myself) try ""Funny Hut."" If Cleveland is too dreary for you, try the sister location in San Diego, ""Sunny Hut."" Or the Bank attached to it ""Money Hut.""

About a year ago I tried their famous cereal milk ice cream and it totally didn't do it for me. The texture of the ice cream is more on the icy than the creamy side - not my favorite.

"Decided to visit this place since it was so hyped by its East Coast stores and it's definitely overrated in my opinion. First of all, the line is almost always really long. You can expect to wait probably at least 15-20 minutes in line. Not sure about the prices in New York but this was probably one of the priciest ice cream places I've been to. A serving of soft-serve is $6 and the milkshakes go from $7-$9 for the basic ones ($12 for alcoholic ones). The serving size of a milkshare is about the size of a Grande cup at Starbucks so it wasn't even that much either. I got the cereal milk milkshake and I actually couldn't even finish it because of the taste. The one good thing was that it wasn't overly sweet but it started tasting worse and worse with every sip. It also felt very heavy for some reason. If you're in Vegas and you want something refreshing to drink/eat, don't come to Milk.

I bought 6, only because I didnt know when i would try them again, and I dont know where I can find these in San Diego. Im really glad i bought that many because they ended up tasting really good!

Caramel, Chocolate, and Vanilla are my favorites but the Raspberry, Pistachio and Coffee are delectable too.

"Two words: Cookie cup!!! The cookie cup is composed of two macaron cookies sandwiching two scoops of ice cream, and topped with a roasted marshmallow. You can choose two different flavored ice cream for the two scoops. If you're feeling adventurous, you can add on the first topping for $.75, and each additional topping for $.50. The toppings are graham crackers, oreos, rainbow sprinkles, & chocolate sprinkles to name a few. The workers were friendly and easy-going. Being an extremely indecisive person, I did not feel rushed to pick a flavor right away. They were really willing to have me sample all 24 ice cream flavors since there was no line behind me. I tried only two flavors, and fell in love with the mocha java yaya and mint chip. I was cracking up at some of the names for the ice cream, such as ""Netflix & Chill"". I would definitely try a couple of samples while having fun at it. The best part was seeing the marshmallow roasted by a torch right before our eyes. If you're looking for something lighter, they also have scoops of ice cream available. This place did not quite get the five stars for me because of the price and sweetness. The first couple of bites into the cookie cup was out of this world amazing. However, the subsequent bites were truly sweetness overload. It's also treading on the pricey side - $7.50 for the cup. I have eaten larger macaron ice cream sandwiches with great flavors for only $4.50. Overall, this place is great for kids. There is a complimentary water station by the napkins. If you're planning to eat your dessert on site, there are a handful of tables inside and a couple of tables outside. Remember to check-in on yelp for 10% off your order.

"Came here after seeing a video and several pictures of the grilled cheese donut sandwich. To my disappointment, we were told they were sold out -so that was the start of it. I got the mexican hot chocolate donut, which was $3. I thought it was worth it, not because of the flavor, it didn't taste much like mexican hot chocolate, or chocolate for that, but it did taste like a good yeast donut. It was huge, which totally made up for the price. My bf got a s'mores donut, which was a big fail. It tasted like a less sweet version of something dunkin donuts (a favorite of mine) would try to make. At $3, and a quarter of the size of my donut, I didn't think it was worth it.

"I have a love for cakes, cookies, pastries and most of all, donuts. Especially on vacation. Because when you are on vacation, everyone knows that all the rules of physics go out the door and any calories you consume are offset by all the walking you do. #truth My first order of business in Las Vegas was to find some delicious donuts other than the Krispy Kreme and Dunkin Donuts variety. Located in downtown Vegas, I found Donut Bar! At the time, I didn't know Donut Bar (original shop in San Diego) was listed as the Number 1 Donut Shop on lists from USA Today, <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FThrillist.com&s=2318db7cc9d2a933066949f28dc05a7139148ba530a91c0fa15454d6d09279f9"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Thrillist.com</a>, MSN and more. But as soon as I walked in, I knew I had found a gem. The donuts they offer are huge, over the top, and look downright amazing! Their most popular is their Big Poppa Tart Donut which is made with a full pop tart and weighs one entire pound! I wanted to try everything, but I decided on three: crÃ¨me brulee, blueberry with meyer lemon, and maple bacon. The crÃ¨me brulee is a yeast donut filled with crÃ¨me topped with a hard candy shell. For those with a sweet tooth, you will love biting into it. For those that like their donuts a little less sweet, the blueberry with meyer lemon is perfect. The cake donut is topped with a perfectly lemony frosting. My favorite was the maple bacon bar. The yeast donut is so soft and topped generously with thick and chewy bacon pieces that paired with the sweet maple frosting like a dream. Mmmmmm.... It's a bit of a gamble as they close when they sell out, but if you visit Donut Bar after 10am, they serve donut ice cream cones!!! I will get one of those one day!",5,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"Came here to whisper the ""secret phrase"" found on Facebook for a free cupcake. Thinking this would be a quick process, I left my party at Yardhouse to see if the secret phrase would work. There was a line of about 3 people ahead of me so I decided to wait. While the couple in front of me was ordering, I figured the next available rep could assist me, she said she could assist but couldn't box up my order, either another supervisor or manager said she could glove up and assist so I told her the secret phrase of the day and she gave me a free cupcake. The process still took longer than I thought, this may be because they are still a brand new business and are still in the learning stage? I've past by Sprinkles over several different occasions and seeing the line is a just a turn off for me, the line starts outside and continues inside. I think after my last experience and waiting a long time for 1 cupcake with only 3 people ahead of me makes me not even think twice about waiting again. The cupcake was delicious (it was the chai latte) and tasted just like a chai latte with a cream cheese frosting, not overly sweet. I also like how they serve ice cream as well which I've never seen at any other Sprinkles location. I will still come back, I just would not want to wait in a long line with stanchions set up like you're getting ready to go into a club, I understand waiting for things that are in high demand, but these are cupcakes and they're already made,cupcakes are one of those things like ice cream and cookies, once you see it you want or instantly. I'll try the cupcake ATM, maybe that'll be more my style, fast cupcakes right away! *great location, lots of restaurants/bars around and Sprinkles is a great way to end the day/night.",4,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Cheat meal wasted. I have this pet peeve. I absolutely hate it when a place is highly rated on my beloved Yelp or even culturally in general, only to find out that it was for novelty over actual superiority. It's like someone hooking you up with someone sexy and you get all excited because they look good in the pictures but you meet them in person and they have no personality. That's donut bar. I waited like months to try this place because I try to eat healthy most of the time. I drooled over the photos of the ""strawberry poppa tart"" the ""creme brÃ»lÃ©e donut"" etc I walked in and saw that ""Brad fritter"" and got one of those too on good faith even though I don't even like apple in baked goods. Because this place has a lot of stars, so its GOTTA BE GOOD. Right?? And after an extra strenuous workout to prep for the big day, I finally got to try all of the donuts I had been pining over. And none of them rocked my world. Not one. I get there and the shop is cute, clean, very nice displays and an absolutely wonderful staff. To my surprise the donuts are even waaaaaaay bigger than pictures communicate. My a*s was EXCITED! I got a strawberry poppa tart, creme brÃ»lÃ©e donut, Brad fritter, Nutella glaze, and birthday cake glaze, and not a single one of them was worthy of more than 2 stars. They are big and fluffy but they catered more to having giant donuts, than delicious ones. Something about the actual donut bodies themselves were just plain and boring and they topped them with glazes & toppings that will get you all exited but are ultimately lackluster as well. Except the candied bacon on the Brad fritter. Best part of the whole donut box was that bacon. That wound up being my breakfast. Do yourself a favor, and head on over to ""Master Donuts"" on the eastside or ""RONALDS DONUTS"" in China town! Theyre the ""change yo lyfe"" type of good donuts.

"Somewhat hard to find as there is minimal signage in the hotel that helps. 15 minute wait total (not bad) which I was prepared for and the staff was nice and answered questions about pricing (since there was none posted). You had to ask for the cannoli because there weren't any in the front case. They tasted good. The pastry was crisp-fragrant with vanilla and the cream rich with pops of chocolate chips. I thought the cream puffs were just ok. We have a New York style bakery were I'm from and their cream puffs are so delicious so I naturally compared the two and was a bit let down. $10 got me a cannoli, cream puff and coffee.

"I thought the bakery was in Paris, not the Venetian! Finding Bouchon Bakery took quite some effort but the search was well worth it indeed. I visited the bakery in Napa earlier this year and knew I had to make a stop at the Vegas location. The bakery is a small kiosk-like place behind the escalator across of the Phantom of the Opera theater (FYI Phantom is leaving Vegas soon so the show here will change). This time, I only picked up a couple of coffee macarons vs. the bazillion I got in Napa. I also grabbed a strawberry croissant, a nutter butter cookie and a vanilla latte. EVERYTHING was good.

I got the milk cereal soft serve which basically tasted like corn flakes soaked in milk for 10 minutes, which might taste bad or good depending on your opinions on corn flakes itself. Despite the high price, I can't say I'm surprised because it is such an aesthetically pleasing food and on top of that it's located in Vegas.

I mean think about it if you are talking on ur phone during the wait fine but at the top of the counter, at Mecca, IN the end zone just order - you aren't supposed to make the chef your new best friend! Honestly the King, the lemon, the dark chocolate strawberry or the Nutella & banana are all fabulous. Savory wise I've only had one and it was ok just not as good as the sweets to me.

They allow to choose 2 scoops of a flavor they offer, then you choose your macaroon flavor, and finally they toast a marshmallow right on top. I'm not one to finish an ice cream dish or dessert but I finished every drop of this cookie cup, it was delicious and I highly recommend this place!!

"Review based on Sprinkles' invite-only Sneak Peek event on Wednesday, March 19th! I received an e-mail from Sprinkles last week inviting me and a guest for a taste prior to their grand opening. The tasting involved complimentary cupcakes (2) and ice cream. Very exciting! We arrived approximately 15-20 minutes before the event (2PM-4PM) and there was already quite the line. We were checked off a list and given cupcake and ice cream menus. The event was pretty organized as they allowed a certain amount of people in at one time as to not overcrowd the intimate shop. The boutique is adorable! Bright colors, their script logo, Sprinkles dots, and treats galore. On the left side of their space is the counter to order cupcakes and beverages. The cupcakes are displayed to your right, flavors labeled with wooden blocks. There were also doggie cupcakes ($2.50) and their ""store"" where you can purchase shirts ($25-40), onesies ($25), cupcake mixes ($14), and a crazy adorable miniature toy replica of a Sprinkles boutique ($16)! On the other side of their boutique is the ice cream counter. There are also two entrances. On the exterior wall, facing O'Sheas, is the very cool Cupcake ATM that is open 24 hours! My guest, Christina, and I bought opted for the Salty Caramel ice cream (one scoop, $3.75) in a Red Velvet waffle cone ($1). I really wanted to try the Coffee Fudge Almond, but they didn't have any! The Salty Caramel was really sweet and much too salty; it was difficult to eat. The Red Velvet cone was delicious! Soft, crunchy, and great flavor. It's a must with your ice cream! We shared four cupcakes ($3.75/each): Chocolate Coconut (Belgian dark chocolate with coconut cream cheese frosting), Ginger Lemon (Spiced ginger cake with lemon cream cheese frosting), Red Velvet, and Strawberry. By the way, I love the wooden utensils with ""Sprinkles"" etched in their handles! We took these home to enjoy since there are only 4-5 seats and a small table facing outside. The cupcakes were all very moist, but didn't have spectacular flavor. Strawberry was our favorite with the best cake flavor and frosting. Yummy and not overly sweet. I didn't care for the chocolate, ginger, or red velvet cakes. The ginger flavor was just okay and it was difficult to detect lemon in the frosting. The chocolate and red velvet didn't taste like much. I did like the coconut frosting very much. I've had prior experience with Sprinkles cupcakes and they're not my favorite, however, there are certain flavors that I really enjoy. The Strawberry was wonderful and I loved the German Chocolate offered last Fall. FYI: Sprinkles is located next to Brooklyn Bowl, near the High Roller. They're open Sunday thru Wednesday 10AM-12AM and Thursday thru Saturday 10AM-1AM. There is a schedule for their cupcake and ice cream flavors, so if you're looking for something in particular, view their website before your visit!",4,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown

"This is for the store next to the gift shop. Major operational screw up made a quick pick up turn into a 20- 30 minute wait for nothing. There was a couple of irate customers who did not receive receipts or their orders and held up the line. The staff could have just remade them the order and let the line move on. Instead they wasted so much time arguing and a big crowd was waiting. I was waiting for my ham and cheese croissant to be warmed so had no choice but to wait.

"As a frequent guest at the Venetian/Palazzo, we always try to squeeze in a stop to Carlos Bakery for a Lobster Tail and coffee. While all of the pastries/desserts look so deliciously tempting, the Lobster Tail is our favorite, ever since we first had it on an NCL cruise I must say that I find a surprising lack of good, friendly service at this Grand Canal Shops location. We usually go there mid-morning after the early morning rush is done. While the counter attendants are quick to serve us, it seems as though they are just going thru the motions and can't wait to return to their chatting with their behind-the-counter coworkers. We always order coffees and ask for cream - I don't understand why there's no cream or half & half at the sugar/mixing counter like their competition? Or, at least have those small disposable containers of cream available at the register. They keep the cream in a fridge under the coffee brewer, and even if I request to pour my own cream, they always insist on pouring it behind the counter. Everyone has their own preference as to how much cream they want - these servers either pour way too much or not enough and we always need to ask for a coffee redo or more cream. The workers then react as if I'm the one that messed up the coffee in the first place or as if I'm asking for too much. On our last visit 11/28/17, when I asked for more cream, the guy told me that they ran out. ????? Too bad, we love the products, but in Vegas there's many other options.",2,Positive,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"I am a huge fan, and a converted popcorn lover. Before encountering Campbell's at a Yelp event, I thought I didn't like popcorn. As I came to learn on Campbell's factory tour (which was awesome!), the reason I like Campbell's and not other popcorns is because of the type of corn kernel they use. Apparently the kind they use has less of the kernel shell that gets stuck in your teeth, which was the whole reason I always hated popcorn. Obviously, the tour was very informative. It was also fun. We made chocolate dipped caramel corn balls, and the tour price included a voucher to spend in the gift shop! I am so addicted to their treats now that I keep trying to come up with reasons to buy bags of popcorn as gifts for people so I have an excuse to visit the store.",5,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Love Bouchon! Picked up a chocolate eclair, ham & cheese baguette (heated up on their panini press, yum!), ""club"" sandwich (also on a baguette, w/ avocado, bacon, sun-dried tomatoes - deeelicious) and 2 macarons - lemon and chocolate. Loved the lemon, which was tart, light and refreshing. The chocolate one was very rich - I had actually ordered raspberry but was given chocolate...didn't discover it until after we left. Be sure to check your bags before you leave the counter! Our goodies totaled up to $30 even - pricey, but a nice once-in-a-while splurge. The bakery is hidden behind some escalators, in front of the Phantom Theatre. No tables or seats, so either head to the food court or to the Coffee Bean on the second floor - not the one right above the bakery (tables are right in front of the counter), but the one around the corner and on the way to the self-parking lot.

"Wow!! This is one of the best soft serve ice cream & Yogurt location in Las Vegas! Handel's Homemade Ice Cream & Yogurt was on my ""to-visit"" list and I finally had a chance to stop by over the weekend on a Sunday afternoon! Handel's Homemade Ice Cream & Yogurt is located off of the 215/Tropicana, a few blocks away. It's within a relatively large shopping plaza with spacious amount of parking. Handel's Homemade Ice Cream & Yogurt's is outside. There are a variety of benches available for seating though! Handel's ice cream has a ton of soft served ice cream flavors, milkshakes, sherbets, brownies and much more! It wasn't too long of a wait. There was two other parties in-front of ours. After reviewing the menu we had ordered the following 1) 4 Scoop Sample - Apple Delight, Cinnamon, Salty Caramel Truffle, Birthday Cake 2) 1 Scoop of Chocolate 3) Blondie with Vanilla ice cream/Whip Cream. The customer service team was super friendly. They were all adhering to the current health safety measures, wearing face masks, gloves, and social distancing. The 4 scoop sample was awesome!! The Apple Delight had almost like a apple cinnamon swirl in the middle. It reminded me of a slice of apple pie. The Cinnamon was super good and flavorful. The Salty Caramel Truffle was my favorite. The caramel flavor was delightful and the truffles added in it gave it a crunch with all of the salty, caramel flavors! The Birthday cake was good. It didn't have a yellow cake flavor, but more of a sprinkles flavor profile. The Blondie was warm, and the vanilla ice cream was a perfect match! Handel's had topped a ton of ice cream and whip cream on it! The sweet treat was delicious! Handel's wasn't too expensive for all of the goodies we had ordered, approximately $17.00.

$3.50 for the red velvet cupcake which was so moist and tasty. I was mostly impressed with the frosting and the fact that it wasn't ultra sweet like most places but creamy just the way I like it.

"I have been following Ice Cream Social since they started as online only business in 2020. I absolutely loved the story behind the shop and their stance on social justice. The owner, Katrina, donates the money from her weekly ice cream sales to organizations in the local community fighting for social and racial equity. Not only is the story amazing, but the ice cream is beyond delicious! It's made from scratch in Madison. They frequently switch out their unique flavors and all the ice cream is gluten free (not that you can tell). So far, I've only tried the monster cookie ice cream. It was absolutely amazing- m&ms and cookie dough in every bite. The ice cream base is so creamy and delicious on its own as well. I can't wait to go back and try more flavors! The shop itself is SO cute! If you've followed Ice Cream Social on Instagram, you know Katrina put her heart and soul into every detail. She hand stained the ice cream bar, designed the sign, picked out all the different paints (possibly painted the shop too) and more. The shop has accent colors of dark blues, yellows, corals, pinks, and whites. It's such a cute combination of colors and works perfectly with all the LED signs and hanging pendant lights.

Even in February there is a line out the door for ice cream. What I like about Jeni's is that they don't have the standard chocolate, vanilla, cookies and cream...etc. Jeni's has flavors like goat cheese and cherries, which I have not had the guts to try yet.

Although every ""famous"" ice cream shop has a ""signature"" ice cream, I'm not familiar that Mitchell's does. Every single time I've been here I've tried a different flavor and every single time I had nothing bad to say about it. If it's either the brownie sundae, milkshake or traditional ice cream cone, you will not be disappointed with that this place has to offer.

"Holy moly. We've lived here 7 years and I am utterly without excuse that it wasn't until today that I had their bread. This, even after my best friend raves about the goods he and his daughter get on a semi-regular basis. Well, one excuse, I guess, is that I bake for my family's needs, for the most part - wheat and rye-based sourdoughs, pastries, and baguettes as well. My neighbors and friends have asked me to go pro with an artisanal bakery (...and I explain that as a former French chef and restaurateur, I'm done). Forget all that. That's merely context to say, I love good bread. No, GREAT bread. I can't believe how wonderful today's baguette was. Depth of flavor went on forever, a perfect mix of salt and sugar fermentation in the crumb, and slash work leaving imposing grins on the loaf that rose like waves and seized at the height of perfection. It takes serious skill to achieve the balance they have, between a crusty but not too-crusty (as in, break a tooth, which yes, I recently did, and it was on my own 15% rye levain, a bÃ¢tard. I'd like to blame an old tooth, but I fear it was a less than skillful bake ) crust, a crumb that tears so satisfyingly before yielding, holes that are evenly and beautifully distributed.... I could go on forever. Probably the best baguette I've ever had, and that's not easy for me to admit.

Reminiscence of a mom and pop bake shop with a colorful hand written menu proudly displayed up top. The goodies are in full presentation behind glass as well as shiny soft serve machines in the back. For my first experience I opted for; 1. Compost Cookie: My favorite of the bunch! The perfect amount of chew with a mixture of salty and sweet flavors from pretzels, potato chips, graham crackers, coffee, oats, and butterscotch. I can totally tell why this is their best selling cookie, even at 4 dollars a pop. Will definitely revisit; 2. Milk Bar/Crack Pie: Not knowing what to expect, I was greeted with a thin pie/cookie concoction which was scrumptious, but overly sweet for my liking. Slightly gooey and nicely chewy with sweet and salty finish. My favorite part has to be the oat cookie crust; 3. Birthday Cake Truffles: Sadly, I can not say I enjoyed this truffle ball much at all. Ultimately, a super sweet and dense cake pop. Just not my thing. Will I return? Probably after a winning run at the craps table so I can try a slice of $14.00 birthday cake that everyone seems to rave about. I have really high expectations when paying 14 bucks for a slice a cake, and would hate to be disappointed.",4,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
I tried the chocolate coconut cupcake. It was moist and just ok. It cost $3.75 plus additional .30 to eat inside. Even though it had a lot of coconut shreds at the top I could barely taste the coconut.

"Some of the best ice cream we've ever had nationwide and at prices that we hadn't seen in years! After a trip to the West Side Market, my wife and I swung by Mitchell's on a warm summer Saturday afternoon at 12pm, which seemed like the perfect timing. The ice cream shop had just opened 30 minutes prior and there weren't many people inside, so we took our time exploring the menu and flavors. From the moment people spot Mitchell's you can tell it's just different. For one, the outside looks like the entrance to a movie theater. Once customers make their way in, they're greeted by a huge glass window straight ahead where you can see into their ice cream making facility. However, what customers really need to focus on is the writing and menu on the glass window, which is not only written in a light white, but incredibly hard to see. I won't dock them any stars for that snafu, but maybe making it a bit darker would have helped, however I get that they want to showcase the factory behind the glass. Anyway, we surveyed the flavors at the ordering counter and the options. We tend to make the mistake of over-ordering, but also what to try as much as we can, so what better option than the Taster's Duo, which is supposed to be a single scoop of 2 different flavors. After being enlightened by the very helpful employees there about their most popular and favorite flavors, my wife ordered the Strawberry Rhubard and Fresh Peach on a sugar cone, while I ordered the Toasted Pistachio and Caramel Fudge Brownie, with the latter supposedly being their most in demand flavor. The verdict? EXCELLENT. The ice cream wasn't too soft and had very good texture to it. The flavors were really good and we loved each and every bite. The Strawberry Rhubard and Fresh Peach were fruity, but savory. The Toasted Pistachio and Caramel Fudge Brownie were sweet, but not overpowering. The Caramel Fudge Brownie had large chunks of brownie inside of the ice cream, which I loved. Overall, the ice cream was delicious and perfect. What was even better was how generous the scoops were. We ordered the Taster's Duo, which was supposed to be 2 half scoops, but when we received our cones, the ice cream was overloaded. It looked like they had given us 2 gigantic single scoops of each flavor we ordered. In addition, the Taster's Duo was just $3.95, which is unheard of these days for ice cream from a shop. I guess we felt we really got our money's worth too because we basically got 2 scoops instead of one. We loved the price point here, but we loved the flavors, serving size and delicious ice cream even more.",5,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Soooooooo disappointed in the cupcakes I bought last night. Bought 4 large and 2 mini about $20+. Ate the mini's on the way to the car, they were fine. Although I had to remove some of the frosting, even on the small ones it is pretty sweet. Got the big one's out for dessert tonight and could NOT finish a whole cupcake. They were so dry I was shocked. And the frosting to cake ratio was for me off. To SWEET! Or maybe it was the dry flavorless cake that was the problem. I thought this product was baked on sight!?

"After I found out that there was a Sprinkles Cupcakes in Las Vegas I HAD to visit the OG of cupcakes. After dinner across the street at Caesars Palace I dragged my Husband across the street and down the block to Sprinkles. There really is no easy way to get there and it's a long walk. It's located in the Linq Promenade and definitely not visible from Las Vegas Blvd as the Yelp map shows. After walking more than halfway down the Linq Promenade (located on your way to the Ferris Wheel) I spotted Sprinkles Cupcakes with its giant lighted sign. I was surprised to see that they weren't busy around 7:00pm on a Saturday so it was nice having some time to browse and not have to stand in a line. The employees were nice and the shop was organized and clean. There are a few seats inside to eat your cupcakes but we chose to take ours and go. I got the Peanut Butter Chocolate Cupcake which was good and I was glad to see it wasn't filled inside. The cupcake had good peanut butter flavor and the chocolate frosting was tasty. I love cupcakes, but couldn't finish this one because it was super sweet. The cupcake itself was a good size, but there was a TON of frosting! My Husband got the Maple Bacon Cupcake and he thought his was OK (he's not a big fan of cupcakes in the first place) and he couldn't finish all his either. I would come back to Sprinkles Cupcakes the next time I'm in Las Vegas because I really like cupcakes. Otherwise I would pass because I've had better cupcakes back home in California.",4,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Must hit place in Charlotte and doesn't hurt that it's located by all things cool in Noda! Open 24 hours, there's never an off-time (although there are many ON times, with a line reaching into separate rooms). You'll know you're in the right spot right away, with all the creative artwork and antique pieces, I've heard it feels just like France (although I will verify AFTER my future visit!) The restaurant is made up of 3 rooms with an eclectic array of chairs and tables. Free wifi, and water too and you'll find outlets along the walls for the necessary charge [NOTE: I discovered the back room gets the best reception during my visit!] You'll walk in and immediately be greeted by a glass counter filled with goodies: pastries and sweet treats. But that's not all that Amelie offers! They've got a breakfast and lunch menu filled with sandwiches, quiche and coffee/teas. I recommend the turkey and brie sandwich, it's served on a baguette with a seedy raspberry jam. I've tried an assortment of treats and much say I need to keep trying! The Napoleon was too messy and tricky to eat: you really need to let it heat up but it falls apart really easily. I also tried a fruit (maybe orange) and tarragon macaron recently that was just ok on flavor although great texture. The downside is that Amelie's is pretty pricy when it comes to their bakery, so you can't go too crazy without the bill going crazy. I'll keep returning until I find the perfect combination, you really can't get over the atmosphere!",4,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown

Unlike other waffles in champaign, their waffles are really sweet without any syrup.

"My first visit to Jarling's was on a Saturday night after a great meal at Thara Thai, also located in Champaign. I'd actually driven past here on a previous occasion while in the Champaign area, but did not stop by. I did some research for dessert options in the area, and Jarling's seemed to be very popular. Going to Jarling's, I knew I wanted to get a snowstorm (similar to Culver's concrete mixer, DQ's blizzard). I also wanted to try their famous 'cold fudge,' which is hot fudge, but it's cold, and does not melt the custard (explanation given to me by a girl working there). Anyways, I decided to go with the Tortoise snowstorm. At first, the girl gave me the tortoise sundae, which i should have started eating, but I gave it back instead. I guess she was confused because I asked what cold fudge was, and cold fudge usually comes on the sundaes, but whatever. It was quickly corrected to a Tortoise snow storm. I also ordered a teddy cup of the cake batter ice cream. A teddy cup at Jarling's is a dip (equvalent to a scoop) with 6 teddy grahams and a cherry. A dip would have been 1.75, but the T cup was 2.25. Not really worth it in my opinion. I was a bit confused by my snowstorm, to be honest. It said it was vanilla custard, although it came out looking like chocolate. The tortoise is supposed to feature cold fudge, almonds, and butterscotch. When the incorrect tortoise sundae was brought out, it was vanilla custard with a fudge topping. For my snowstorm, it was a different color, so I was confused. I also did not taste any butterscotch, which I was really looking forward to. I went here with my bro, and he ordered the same teddy cup, as well as a Macaroon snowstorm. I had a bit of his, and it was much better than mine. I think they may have mixed up my order, but either way, the custard was still very good. The cake batter custard was nothing special, to be honest. No pieces of cake batter, or any sprinkles.They have a weekly special of flavors, along with their regular (see their new updated website). Just a side note, we came here at 845 on a Saturday night, and it was pretty crowded inside. There are multiple benches inside, as well as a drivethru. We decided to order and head to my car, which was parked in one of the angle spots. While eating, 2 wonderlake fire dept trucks pulled on both sides of us. A girl who got out of one of the trucks decided to open her car door on my exterior, and didn't even bother to check anything. Not sure I'd want her responding to a fire of mine (nothing against jarling's, but it did happen there). 15 dollars for our 4 dishes. I'm not sure if I will be getting a snowstorm or a sundae on my next trip, but I will be back! I think I should have gone with something coconut, PB, or chocolate chip based next time. I'll be honest, I was disappointed in my Tortoise, but I will go back because I love dessert, and I'd prefer this place over DQ, any frozen yogurt place, or McD. I'd actually put it on par with Culver's, but I love local business, and I'd like to see if my experience coudl be improved.",4,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown

"I've been going here since the soft opening and all I can say it's ok. The bakery is a hit or miss depending on the day you visit. It is limited with the breads they have and every time I come here and most things run out very fast. I'm a big fan of fruit tarts and the berry one they have here is ok. The last time I came here, I was impressed with the Fresh Strawberry Milk Tea because whenever I see this at other places I am hesitant to try it. I'm afraid it might taste like Nesquik! LOL. Surprisingly, this drink hit the taste buds on the right spot. It included strawberry bits which is a bonus. The rest of their milk teas honestly just taste like half and half milk, which I am not a fan of. Also, a drink I usually get and love is their iced sea salt coffee! I would recommend this for any coffee lovers, it's not too strong-- it's just the perfect everyday iced coffee with a kick of sea salt creme. If it's a hot day, I recommend to try the iced grapefruit green tea! This place deserves a 3 star.",3,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"OH MY YUMMY I have a strong appreciation for many things in life and one of them is cupcakes. Sprinkles needs to expand west and get some more locations near me! Or maybe it's best they stay in Vegas so I have an excuse to go back! There is such a great variety here. All of their ingredients are pronounceable it almost makes me want to endorse the place as healthy! This is only my second visit and I ""only"" got two this time but they were both wonderful. I ate them too fast I forgot to take pictures (no, not both at the same time)! I ordered the triple cinnamon or double something or other, it tasted like a snickerdoodle spice cake with cinnamon frosting. The second was the ""sprinkles"" flavor which I believe is just their vanilla cake with white frosting and rainbow sprinkles. Both hit the spot. The place is always packed it seems, but the servers stay happy and always seem to be smiling. It's open late and there is an ice cream bar attached that is also quite tasty!

Drove 15 minutes here and was so disappointed. Ice cream taste like someone went to the dollar store bought the cheapest vanilla ice cream they could find, added a bunch of unnecessary food colorings which gave the ice cream a metal aftertaste and dumped a bunch of sugar in it. Taste like something I would give a bunch of two year olds at a kids birthday party but that's only if I didn't like the kids. But I love kids so I would never do that. I'm the type of person where even if I don't like my food I'll finish it so it won't go to waste but I happily threw it out after the second bite.",1,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

After tonight's carry out order consisting of 2 orders of char siu pork ramen we call it the best ramen in town. Excellent pork ramen and they nailed the broth. The added bonus of their house made spices and chile oil put it over the top. The egg is lightly poached so the yolk oozes into the broth. SFG! We couldn't get a picture good enough to give it justice so you'll have to look at other photos if you need to. Excellent customer service as well. Only caveat is they run out quick so call ahead to reserve your bowl of greatness! You can add extra meat and totally worth it. Second time in and we called ahead to reserve our order not knowing what time we'd be in. Found out what makes their noodles so amazing. They get them in fresh from a place in Hawaii!

"Turned to Yelp to find a dessert option while in Phoenix and was not disappointed by Novel Ice Cream. We were intrigued by the Leslie Knope (ice cream sandwich made on mini waffles), which was every bit as good as it sounds. We arrived around 8:30 PM on a Saturday and street parked because the nearby lot was full. There was a short line outside of the shop that was a bit slow-moving, but the level of individual attention we were given inside explained the brief wait. When it was our turn, the owner himself waited on us. When he learned it was our first time, he explained the shop's background, walked us through all of the flavors, and encouraged free samples. I wish I hadn't come straight from dinner --- I would have loved to order the Indecision, which allows you to get scoops of multiple different flavors. BF and I split a double scoop with Fat Elvis and bourbon caramel toffee crunch and it was phenomenal. I was nicely surprised at how affordable it was, too --- we ordered 3 different things to be split amongst 3 couples and the total was under $15.

Some donuts were really good like the blueberry cheesecake, vegan red donut, Boston cream etc. But some were either super dry or super disappointing (like the butter beer one :( very cute looking but not enough butterscotch flavor). The chai latte was decent but super small for a ""medium"" I would come back for certain ones but wouldn't get any of the original cake donuts since the they seem to always be dry.",3,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"The last time we were in Vegas and I noticed Milk Bar, I almost lost it. I read about them in multiple magazines and couldn't wait to try their treats out for myself. Being that we were there to celebrate my husband's birthday, I figured it was the perfect excuse to buy the birthday cake truffles. You can purchase them either in store (3 truffles to a pack) or online. Make sure that you have somewhere cold to store them if you aren't planning to eat them right away though as they require refrigeration. Because I bought them the day before as a surprise, I also got myself cereal milk soft serve to enjoy then and there with a corn flake crunch topping. It was not at all what I was expecting. Their soft serve is sweet, but not in the way vanilla ice cream is. It's more subtle and was almost tart alongside the crunchy cereal. The combination was so addictive, I couldn't put it down long enough to snap a picture. And those truffles? Worth every freaking penny. Here is a description taken from their webpage; 'vanilla rainbow cake mixed with vanilla infused milk, coated with white chocolate and rolled in rainbow cake crumbs'. Yes to all those things please! Unfortunately the lady working the night I went was annoyed with the world and practically rolled her eyes while taking my order. Nevertheless, the guy who actually gave me the items was very nice. It's more than I'm used to spending for dessert, but when in Vegas I suppose. Their cookies also looked ridiculously good, and I saw lots of people ordering the 'crack pie'. Having now tried the truffles from the store, I'm curious to see how well they hold up when ordered online. The next time a birthday rolls around I just might give it a try. Definitely a good option when your sweet tooth craving strikes and you're in the mood for something a little different.",4,Positive,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"Even if they're all sold out of goodies, they're worth the hype alone for their Tres Leches draft coffee. I've been an OG fan of Cris and the Batchmaker since she first started selling goodies out of her house in Huntersville. Now she's on 2.0 of her Batch House bakery and I'm still obsessed. Coming from a resident Batchmaker orderer, the OCPs (Oatmeal Cream Pies) and the S'mores Brownie are MUST gets -- she's absolutely famous for them and you'll understand why when you have a bite yourself. Really any of her brownies are to-die-for because her recipe contains half part chocolate to the rest of the ingredients...so they're ooyey fudgey goodness! On the cookie end, her Puddle Cookies are jam packed with delicious chocolate. And for cake, you cannot go wrong with any slice she offers! Honestly, If I come and she doesn't have what I was looking for I order something else or order what's available because anything and everything she touches is amazing. She does custom orders of her treats and her cakes, so check out her website. I've ordered many custom goodies from her over the years for holidays or just-because. She sells out FAST everyday. So get here first thing in the morning or order ahead for bigger orders.

After about a 5-7 minute wait, we made it to the ice cream counter where we were greeted by two very sweet employees. They let us sample the Tiramisu (a seasonal flavor) and Vietnamese Coffee ice creams, and that first bite confirmed our orders. We ordered 2 kids scoops because they did not skimp on their scoop size!! I ordered a tiramisu ice cream, and they checked my ID to ensure I was over 21 since the ice cream did have trace amounts of amaretto in it (not enough to get me drunk, fortunately or unfortunately). This was truly tiramisu in a cup, complete with small pieces of ladyfinger biscuits mixed into the batter! It was a rich, sweet ice cream mixed with chocolatey, subtle coffee flavors.

One slice was almost $7 but I thought it was worth it. My vegan cake was pretty dense but also very light. The flavored buttercreams were very light in general and was nice when paired with tea.

"This is one of my preferred bakeries on the strip where I tend to stop by every time that I'm in Vegas. It is a small outlet hidden behind the escalator on the casino level of the Venetian, so may be a little hard to find if you don't know what you are looking for. They seem to be pretty popular as I've encountered a line each time, but it moves fast. I've tried a bunch of their baked good like cupcakes, chocolate croissants, danish, scones, sticky buns, beignets, cookies etc over my visits. All their products are fresh and taste great specially the sticky buns which are loaded with pecans and have a coating of caramelized sugar which balances the taste of the pecans very well still they tend to be on the sweet side. The cream danish on the other hand has only a mildly sweet filling that will appeal to people who don't want their deserts too sweet.

"So the idea behind this place is that the soft serve is supposed to taste like the milk that is left in your bowl after eating cereal. You can get the cereal milk, fruity cereal milk or red velvet.

We chose some interesting sounding ones and I braced myself to be disappointed. These ain't your normal starbucks brown bag croissants. Carrot cake cookie sandwich- the cookies were moist with chunks of raisin and nuts. The icing was the perfect consistency and sweetness. Strawberry croissant- the flavor of the jam is harmonious with the buttery lightness of the croissant. Chocolate almond- the chocolate ganache filling was plentiful and not cloyingly sweet. Both croissants were light but yet had a crisp but not too crumby exterior. Pistachio macaroon- the gold standard to which othet macaroons will be measured. Perfect crisp ""shell"" with a wonderful, chewy but not stale interior. The filling added to the cookie without taking away from it.

I wasn't in any rush or anything so I was patient and was willing to wait 10 minutes if I had to. Had I not had too much time on my hands then it would've been a different story. Anyway... first thing my son and I tried were the chocolate chip cookies. Super delicious. What made me even love them more was that my son said he couldn't stop eating them and that next time we go we should order a lot of them. He said that it was the best cookies he's ever eaten.

"This is going to be a short review because that's all you need. GO HERE. They have 5 permanent flavors and a few rotating flavors all made in house. That's not the reason you need to go though. This is: 1) Donut ice cream sandwich: select a flavor and they make a sandwich by slicing a donut in half and warming it up. Seriously amazing. 2) ""Leslie Knope Special"" AKA waffle ice cream sandwich: for those of you who watch parks and rec, you know about Leslie's obsession with waffles. Here, they take a sweet twist on it by creating a waffle sandwich which is warmed up and your pick of ice cream in between. I seriously can't pick one over the other, so you'll have to get both or go twice!",5,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"I have walked by this place for almost a year and never even thought about going in to try it until I saw a picture of a couple of the ice cream sandwiches from here on the Offline app. The one picture I saw was of a strawberry shortcake ice cream sandwich, and then I knew I had to give this place a try. I'm so glad I did! I recently had a friend in town so it gave me the perfect reason to try something local and new, and who doesn't love ice cream. We went in around 9pm, and business was boomin! The weather was beautiful, so lots of people were out and about, and the place had good vibes. My friend tried one of their donut ice cream sandwiches, and it looked delicious! I ended up trying one of the R U Cereal macaroon ice cream sandwiches, because I couldn't pass up the opportunity to have ice cream and lucky charms! Both were delicious.

My favorite ice cream place in Charlotte! I love their unique flavors. My favorite flavor is their Wildberry Lavender. The location is in South End. There is minimal seating inside and a few tables outside. Parking can be a little difficult on the weekends but I love how it's walkable to many places in South End. The line can get kind of crazy but the smell of the fresh waffle cones might convince you to stay. My friends and I always get the trio where you can pick 3 flavors and share. Service has always been great with smiling faces.

"I want to focus on ordering their fast food items and Sundays, which might not have been covered by other reviews. I wanted to get a quick dinner there in addition to some ice cream being that it was a hot day. I ordered a cheeseburger with tomato, lettuce and onions and the Yinzer Sunday. After I ordered the food she asked me if I wanted the Sunday with the hot food and I told her I would get that separate. I am not sure how many orders they get for food because this took quite a while. When I finally got it I was pretty impressed with the burger though. It was nicely cooked and had good bread. The fries were a bit limp and not crisp like they should be, but I was o.k. with that. I went back to get the Yinzer sunday because it is one of my favorites. Vanilla ice cream with a blondie brownie, caramel syrup, wipped cream and nuts on top. It is quite lovely and more than one person can typically handle. Drawbacks to Page: The location of this place is a disaster that always happens. This is because it is right at the corner of where 2 busy roads meet(West Carson and Becks Run Road). You pull in off of Carson and no one knows where to go when they are leaving. There is no set way of doing things. When you leave, where do you go? If you try to go back the way you came onto Carson there is traffic stopped at the light blocking your path and other traffic coming in the next lane. You can circle around onto Becks Run Road, but you will have to wait for traffic to stop moving coming from Becks, which takes forever, or they will be stopped at the light on the other side of the corner and you will have to wait for that also. Either way it makes for a very akward visit. And this is when it is not so busy, if it is busy expect more confusion and utter chaos. If you are a patient person than ignore what I have just said and go there all the time.",4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,Positive,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown

"Only in Las Vegas can you escape the real life dream come true of hanging out by a Venice canal in St. Marks Square to feel like a little kid for a few minutes in a candy store. That happened to me on a staycation evening last week. Both my dad (who flew in from New York) and I appreciate hanging out inside the Venetian's St. Marks Square. It is the next best way to spend time in Venice to the real Venice. To make quality time in this quality Venice meets Vegas resort even better is delicious food. Under the bright blue sky ceiling above St. Mark's Square is Sloan's Ice Cream Parlor. At ground level, it was a short stroll across a pedestrian bridge crossing the Venice Canal. Savoring my time in this dreamscape of Venice themed eye candy it was time for me to savor some real candy: ice cream. Originating in Florida, Sloan's is an ice cream shop chain that produces walls of delectable treats including doughnuts, cookies, and a wall of candy. They sell adorable gifts including stuffed animals. Just walking along the cobblestone Venice walkway, my eyes were drawn from the gandolas and canal to these puppies sleeping in a cage by the entrance. Upon further inspection I saw that they are breathing stuffed animals. The pink color tone creates a carnival midway atmosphere alongside the canal. The main attraction is the ice cream. I am talking a sundry of ice cream flavors that include: Checker Boys Rum Raisin, Coffee & Doughnuts, Mom's Apple Pie, & Scout's Honor. Where the seats are nil inside and far and few outside in the Square, the prices are exorbitant. The prices are so high for a couple of scoops, I would recommend splurging a few more dollars for a sundae. On my leading visit, I ordered the Peanut Butter Cup Sundae. At a price a few cents short of $10 after taxes, it included 3 scoops of peanut butter ice cream, generous amount of small peanut butter cups, hot Fudge, whipped cream, & a cherry in a plastic bowl. It was a high price that was a small price to pay for enjoying a delicious sundae in a Venice dreamscape. It was so delicious that I planned to end the staycation a few days later with the Strawberry Fields Ice Cream Soda. On the second visit that took place on Friday, May 4; I told their employee Elijah to make the ice cream soda with two scoops strawberry and 1 scoop strawberry cheesecake. I thought about ordering it on the first visit, however, they were out of strawberry ice cream. Upon exchanging $9.52 with the cashier, this was my expectation. However, when I stood by a chairless high table taking in the sight of gondolas passing by on the canal, my taste buds took in a disappointing ice cream soda. It started out delicious. The scoops of strawberry ice cream were out of this world delicious. However, when I progressed to the lower levels of the paper cup the Strawberry Fields met the swamp. First off the Strawberry cheesecake ice cream that I ordered was nonexistent. The biggest dunce ice cream soda moment in my life turning it into the crappiest ice cream soda that I ever set my teeth into was that it was made from Diet Pepsi. What ice cream server in their right mind uses Diet Pepsi as a base of an ice cream soda?! Yuck! It's like, ""yeah I'll take all the sugary ice cream, maybe whip cream, toppings, Fudge, and a Diet Pepsi."" It was absolutely disgusting causing me to throw the rest away along with one star from the rating. What a disappointment! Although I was disappointed in the ice cream soda, there is potential for a return visit. Let's face it, how many ice cream parlors overlook a Venice Canal in Las Vegas? If I do return, I would stick to a sundae. Unlike an ice cream soda, I can visually see the ice cream. Most likely I will return to the Linq Promenade Ghirardelli Ice Parlor before returning here. In reality my dream come true of savoring ice cream overlooking a Venice Canal running through St. Marks Square in Las Vegas is not over. Just postponed indefinitely.",3,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive

"I was very excited when I heard about Amelie's-hoping Charlotte finally got a good, European-style bakery. So I went there a few days ago for lunch with a friend. Was mesmerized by the display case of tarts, eclairs, croissants, pains au chocolate, and a few cakes. The employee at the counter told us they also had lunch available, so we decided to stay for lunch. The sandwiches-a roast beef sandwich and a Croque-monsieur-were good. The CM actually was awesome. But 2 sandwiches and 2 sodas cost around $17, if I remember correctly. We got some sweets to go-one large Napoleon and a chocolate croissant. I I should have known by the dark brown color of the pastry that the Napoleon was over baked, but I went ahead and got it. And tasting it I knew that the pastry was definitely way overcooked and the filling could not overcome that over-baked flavor. I suspect the baker must have been Prussian and didn't care for the namesake of this dessert, because everything else in the case looked good. The pain au chocolate (which I saved for breakfast the next morning) was good too. I honestly am more of a cake person, so I may go back to try one or two of the cake-y items they have, and the tarts look good too. I left with an overall good impression (any 24-hour bakery gets high marks in my book). The prices also seemed a bit high, but perhaps I am just used to my local latino bakery, where everything seems ridiculously cheap. Definitely a good place to get something different, and I will definitely go back.",4,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown
"The bread of the day, cracked wheat, reminds me so much of what my classmates and I started to get fat on at the hostel in Madrid. Thick crust with a nicely textured inside.

"Was super excited to try out Milk Bar after watching Christina Tosi's episode of Chef's Table and knew I had to stop by. We ordered a slice of crack pie and a cereal milk soft serve as a post-lunch dessert. As many others have said, everything here is expensive and in my opinion, not worth the high price-tag. The cereal milk soft serve tasted nice, wasn't too sweet, and had a lighter texture than many soft serves I've tried before but I felt that there really wasn't anything special or memorable about it- at least not enough to warrant $6 (& this is without the cereal flakes on top). Now moving on to the crack pie, I was pretty shocked with the size, this thing is SMALL. My boyfriend is honestly still appalled that we paid over $6 for this but I personally think it's a better deal than the soft serve. Yes it's small but it is really dense and filling. It has a beautiful buttery and sugary taste that I really enjoyed - I'd probably bump my rating up to 4 stars if the price of this dropped to about $4 or $5 to be honest. Overall I think Milk Bar is the type of place you visit just to say you've visited. The prices are simply too high- even if it does taste pretty good. I would only be back if I was SUPER craving crack pie or if I won a nice little jackpot downstairs (then I'd buy the entire crack pie for ~$50)",3,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

At first we each got 1 croissant... but after finishing our croissants we went back to stock up on more for the rest of the day. I'm not someone who enjoys eating any sort of bread, muffin, or pastry...but I seriously can eat 3+ Bouchon croissants in one sitting.

"I have been to Mitchell's before but never toured it! Today I went to this location for a work event. We had an awesome tour guide (I'm drawing a blank on her name) who taught us all about the history of Mitchell's and the building. Did you know that Mitchell's uses solar panels to power some of the W. 25th location? They also collect rain water sanitize it and then use it for their plumbing? I thought that was really awesome and had no idea they were so environmentally conscious. Anyways we got to watch them making different kinds of ice cream and homemade brownies. At the end of the tour we went upstairs (they have an elevator for those who can't take the stairs) and got a better look of the production room. We then got to sample ice cream that was made just this morning - autumn caramel apple and bing cherry. I'm not a cherry fan so I only had the caramel apple flavor but it was delicious! It tasted like apple cider with caramel. We also got to sample some homemade toppings - brownies, cookie dough, and crumble. I ended my visit with the ""Cleveland Brownie Sundae"" this thing is huge!

"After hearing about Milk & their looong lines in New York, I was excited for it to open in Vegas at the Cosmo. It finally opened in late December & I was able to see what the ""hype"" was all about. We got a slice of the Crack Pie, cereal milk soft serve with cornflake toppings & crack pie soft serve with cornflake toppings as well. I spent $20 for these three items. I also was confused about the toppings & thought the cornflakes already came with the soft serve but I was wrong. However, they were nice about it & didn't charge me $2 for the two toppings ($1 per topping). I tried my crack pie soft serve first. My first bite was good with the salty cornflake topping mixed with the super sweet soft serve. But after a few bites, especially when I ate all the toppings already, it wasn't that great. It was also messy to eat since they overload the soft serve onto a mini cup so be prepared with extra napkins or wet ones. I didn't even bother finishing my soft serve since it wasn't worth it anymore. Next, I tried their crack pie. I've read reviews on yelp about how good it is; however, when I took a bite, I wasn't impressed. There was nothing extraordinary or good about it. It was cold & mushy. It didn't taste like anything, tbh. I wish I could say Milk was amazingly good & too die for. But I would be lying if I said it did. It was disappointing.

"My husband and I were on our way home from grocery pickup and decided to get a quick treat from Rewind. After much deliberation, I decided on the Rose Milk Latte and my husband ordered the Hojicha Latte. The employees were friendly and speedy in getting our drinks made and out to us, especially appreciated during these times! My Rose Milk Latte was as expected; definitely had a subtle Rose flavor and at 75% sweet, was a good amount of sweetness ... I only ordered the smaller size last time, but would probably get the large next time. I had gotten my drink with the crystal boba which was pretty difficult to find. Not sure what the normal amount is but the quantity I received left me wishing there was more. The Hojicha Latte had a very distinct flavor, almost earthy. Probably would not get this one again but this drink had much more boba than mine. Overall, a cute litte spot. They have a variety of tea drinks, ice creams, shakes, and so on.

Went to Somisomi in Henderson and counter asked where my mask was. So I walked out. I watched from the window four feet from her was a crowd of unmasked customers eating ice cream.

Go! The Ice Cream is AMAZING. My boyfriend introduced me to this place this year. Boy we are hooked and go twice a month. The seasonal Strawberry Rubarb and Coffee Ice Cream is amazing.

"Milk Bar has become synonymous with Foodie must-have while in any town that has one. Being a Vegas local, I have gotten several opportunities to make my way down to the Strip to stop here (and Momofuku, but that's another review in itself), both conveniently located withing Cosmopolitan. If you've seen Christina's episode on Netflix's 'Chef's Table,' you can't help BUT be excited to stop by and sample her genius and innovation! Firstly, the 'storefront.' This is NOT a sit-down restaurant, not is it like a cafe where you can place your order and hang out at a table. Think 'brick and mortar ice-cream truck. This, in my opinion, helps keep Milk Bar's philosophy of appearing approachable, not too pretentious despite the hype. You feel comfortable there in its casual-meets-foodie vibe. The food. OH GOD THE FOOD! I'll keep it brief. The Crack Pie defines itself, and it's accurate. The Compost Cookie is the best mix of flavors and textures, incorporating chew, crunch, and crisp with sweet, salty, coffee, etc. The Blueberry Cookie was a recent try that blew me away - so subtly sweet and soft, one was not enough. My personal favorite: The Birthday Truffles: Dense, moist, almost too sweet but dances along that line perfectly. I also chose to treat myself last birthday with their Birthday Truffle Birthday Cake: the cake itself was incredible, but because there is no frosting, anything past day one starts to dry out a bit. I personally was not a big fan of the 'truffles,' which I assumed were birthday truffles, but were more like hard (very hard) crumbles of the same material. It detracted from the birthday cake experience for me, but Milk Bar has so many more redeeming qualities that I couldn't justify removing a star for that. Finally, I recently got to try the soft serve cereal milk with the corn flake bits - mind blowing. It truly transported me to childhood breakfasts of frosted flakes. Again, the sheer innovation with these creations are enough to keep me coming back, but then you throw in the fact that it all tastes, looks, and balances incredibly well, and it's safe to say we all know why this is a must-have.",5,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Oh dear Batch. It's such a good thing you are on the complete opposite side of town from me. Otherwise I would be one enormous unhealthy person. Everything here is ridiculously delicious. And I agree with the other reviewers-the various croissants are the closest thing I've come to outside of Paris (and I've tried my fair share across the USA!). Their latest creation, the cini-mini is absurdly good and I'm not even much of a cinnamon sugar treat fan. The Gruyere croissant is easily one of the best things I've ever eaten and while Batch may be far from the far west side, this delectable treat is available at the West Towne Metcalfe's (weekends only and you better go early!) as well as Willy Street West. Yummmmm. The olive fougasse (sp?) is also super delicious. But why bother saying that cuz everything here is super delicious. There is always a wide variety of sweet and savory, various fruit flavors (oh the mini sunny lemon, oh yes! The mini sunny lemon) as well as chocolate and non-chocolate delights. All this plus bread, filled rolls, great coffee and a small refrigerated case near the register with mini-key lime pies and the prettiest little cookie sandwiches I've ever seen. Oh yeah, and the people who work there are extremely patient as I stare and drool and try to decide what not to purchase this time. That's right, what NOT to buy. Cuz if left up to me and no one was looking, I'd eat one (or two) of everything in the case. And that's saying something cuz the selection is huge (as long as you go before 10ish on the weekends!).

Yesterday, after seeing a $5 Monday movie at the south side works cinema, we went to Pages. We've been a few times together now, and I think on it fondly. They have a classic soft serve, very tasty, with almost every flavor I could imagine wanting. I become overwhelmed at the menu. I find that going with a peanut butter sundae with whipped cream, a chocolate dip cone, or a butterfinger shake is always good. Parking can be a bit sticky... but it does have its own lot.

The desserts are really good but the wait was not worth it.

"You'll get the same chocolate and ice cream here as you would at any other Ghirardelli, but most of the time when you come in, you'll have to sacrifice a good bit of your personal space. We managed to find enough space for ten people in the shop and everyone enjoyed what they ordered, especially the younger ones in our group. We came in on a Tuesday night around 9 PM and there wasn't too much room inside. Even if it was just my wife and I, we would have had a difficult time finding a place to sit. So if you come for some ice cream, don't be surprised if you order and have to finish your dessert elsewhere. After the previous patrons got up, we cleaned the table ourselves and everyone had a seat but we were bumping elbows with the parties next to us and had other customers hovering over our table as they waited to place their order. We ordered nine items and everything came out in a timely manner. Four of the orders were just single scoops of ice cream with total bill being $70. All of the sundaes are served in plastic cups instead of the customary sundae glasses with long spoons which even though they probably weren't, makes it seem like the portions are smaller. I had the Ocean Beach which was s nice combination of vanilla ice cream, caramel, hot fudge, and sea salt. By the way, if you're with a group and thinking about ordering the The Earthquake, don't do it. We've done it before and it's a sloppy mess and nowhere near worth the $30+ price tag. There are better places for ice cream in the city but if you're in the LINQ and just can't get up and go elsewhere, Ghirardelli should work as long as you can handle the masses and elevated prices.",3,Positive,Negative,unknown,Negative,unknown,Negative,Negative,Positive,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,Positive

Donut Bar compared to other donut shops around town is their HUGE donuts ($4 each), and unique ones like the Oreo inside the donut, the pop tart inside the donut, and hopefully the donut cones soon (well that's what they advertised on their Instagram). The dough is exceptionally chewy, moist, the toppings are even & proportionate, and most importantly the frosting isn't overly sweet.

I got a single scoop, which was decently sized. The ice cream itself was average. Since it was my first time there, I got a free roasted marshmallow. The marshmallow was also average. Prices are slightly above average, and it's also $1.00 up-charge for waffle cone, bowl, etc. They have their signature item which is a scoop of ice cream, macaroon, and toasted marshmallow for $6.50, which I thought was mildly pricey for what you're getting.

"Welcome to the Republic. The Republic of rich, luscious ice cream! They have some unique flavors, including some holiday flavors like peppermint, gingerbread, and eggnog. After browsing through the flavor selection, I decided on an ice cream sandwich ($4.50) with the gingerbread ice cream. The cookies included with the sandwich are either chocolate chip or molasses but you can also upgrade to a premium cookie (A chocolate chip oatmeal concoction) for $10. I felt like mixing it up so I had a chocolate chip on one side and a molasses on the other. The ice cream itself was great and I loved the bits of gingerbread mixed in with the ice cream. The cookies though tasted too sweet for my tastes so when I bit into the sandwich all I could taste was a generic sweetness rather than the actual ingredients. Also, while the molasses cookie had a nice chewiness that made it easy to eat with the soft ice cream, the chocolate chip was harder. Service was warm and friendly.

We decided to get the Maiko Special with a vanilla hojicha ice cream swirl. Overall, I loved it. It had a matcha cake in it that I actually liked. It also had a special matcha ice cream in it which I really didn't like, but was able to avoid. They use the same waffle cones as Jeni's which I love. I tried some of my friends black sesame waffle cone which was great. Warning: the hojicha and matcha products have caffeine in them. It makes sense if you think about it but I forgot since I was just eating dessert and it kept me up half the night (I don't drink caffeine). The decor is really well done.

As it was our first time here, we tried several flavors (yes, I mean SEVERAL) before deciding on coffee, cinnamon toast crunch and salted caramel. We got the ""cookie cup"" (the mini daddy) and it consisted of 2 scoops of ice cream, a macaron and a toasted marshmallow on top. It. Was. Delicious. I would have gotten the fruity pebbles ice cream (also bomb) but just was in the mood for the cinnamon toast crunch. They have many flavors of wonderfully chewy macarons as well, some in stock and others not. Wanted to try almond but they were out, so I had coconut and it was quite tasty. The flavor was subtle snd didn't overpower the ice cream. We decided to sit outside on their little front patio and enjoyed our cookie cups under the hanging lights. Delightful. Definitely coming back!",5,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown
"Great place for a sugar rush and stomachache! Jokes aside, these donuts are something else. I would HIGHLY recommend you share a donut with a friend (or two) and not take one on yourself like I did. Go early as they do sell out throughout the day. My first time here, I was browsing the huge selection but what caught my eye was PISTACHIO. All time favorite, had to try it - even if it was pistachio lemon. Boy was I impressed. The lemon flavor punches you in the face, but the pistachio caresses you and makes it all better. The balance of flavor they manage to pack into the donut is spectacular. The size is on the outrageous side, but it definitely makes it worth the price. Their coffee is also top notch and pairs well with any donut you decide to devour. I would take visitors to town here, but I would hesitate on coming regularly. Although it's a damn good donut, my stomach would hate me.",4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

Long lines. Slow service. Overpriced. Not impressed with pastries taste& presentation. Packaging is cute but unnecessary and time consuming.

Even the little toys are fun to check out while waiting your turn. The staff was super friendly and outgoing. I had the butter pecan in a pretzel cone (kinda funky). If you like sweet and salty then this is for you. I loved it. My friend had the double chocolate and Madagascar vanilla with hot fudge. I totally had food envy. I'm not a super big ice cream eater but I enjoyed it and it's so very fresh it reminds me of homemade. I'm headed back to buy some candy soon and maybe some jacks.

"Visiting from CA! The interior is cute and seems like a popular place to study/bring the aunties to lounge and converse. Decorations and ambience is 5/5. As for the actual food and drinks....let me begin with the drinks! I am a big Italian Creme Soda Girl and I loved every sip of my Peaches and Creme soda!!!! It is basically fresh milk with carbonated water/soda and peach purÃ©e. 10/5. I loved it so much and was sad that I finished it so fast. The iced coffee was eh my little sister drank it but wasn't raving (she loves Dunkin' Donuts vanilla coffee)....and now for the pastries...We both love Honey + Butter (macaroon specialty shop in SoCal). Upon seeing the flavors and the macaroons on display we opted not to get any. The flavors were a bit basic, but I am sure they are a classic macaroon, just not up to the standard of creativity and presentation that is offered back home. We got the peaches and creme tart instead and the raspberry merengue one. They weren't bad but it was a bit underwhelming. I would say pass on those and get the macaroons or like the strawberry fruit tart before going for those. I will give the pastries we tried a 2/5. It looked better than it tasted, which is a common bummer for many bakeries, not just this one! But still it was underwhelming enough for me to bump two stars because I really went to this place to try the baked goods with ambience as a plus but it was really vice versa-- Overall, will I be back if I ever go back to NC? If I am in the area then yes I will come back for the peaches and Creme soda, then YOU BET. But then again I can make my own from this side of the ocean so it was a good experience and I took some nice photos for the memories!",3,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown

I am not a big ice cream or frozen custard fan. I had never been to Jarlings before and I have lived in this area all my life. I started a new job and was asked if I wanted something from Jarlkings. Since they were buying I said OK I will try it. I ordered the special for simplistic sakes. I surely could not pick one thing out of all the choices they have. The special was a carmel apple snowstorm and it is fantastic. I ordered a small but I couldn't finish it so I put it in the freezer and ate it again the next day and I think I liked it a little better the second time because it was frozen more than the first if that makes any sense.,4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

When I got home I went online to their website and discovered that the location by the Sports Book opened in December. I got a box of their delicious and addicting Macarons, a Nutter Butter, and a TKO. The Nutter Butter and TKO were good but not an ""oh my goodness"" good. I don't think I'll be getting them again.

"Who needs leftover Halloween candy when there is a pint of Sweet Republic in the freezer? NOT ME!! It took me a long time to get here. I kept reading about it and dreaming of the flavor combinations. Finally, I decided to make the 30 minute drive from my hood to Sweet Republic. My first time was about two months ago and since then I have been back a few times. I'll find an excuse to run some errands in Tempe and then say. . .""well, we might as well go to SR, we ARE halfway there!"" The ice cream is just as delicious as everyone says it is. The flavors are amazing. My favorite is the Espresso and the Salted Butter Caramel. That is usually the pint I take home while I enjoy two scoops of something else while I'm there. The Honey Blue Cheese is fantastic (if you like blue cheese), mix with the Date for a little sweet twist. The Mint is a perfect fresh mint flavor and the Cabernet & Pear Sorbet is just like a wine slushy. Next on the to-try list has to be the Chocolate Guinness and the Jameson. You better believe I'm watching the FB status updates for those two! During my first experience in the store, I was served by the smiley woman in all the press. She was very friendly and let me try anything I wanted. I couldn't have had a better experience. After eating my two scoops I went back up to get my pint to-go. She remembered, after a rush of customers behind my first order, that I had a far drive and offered to pack three baggies of ice to put on my pints so they stayed frozen. Major cool points!! I agree with a few other reviews, the other times I have been, the service was not quite five stars, but still they were nice. Like the cliche goes . . .

"We are from OC. Went to Vegas & were recommended this place. I saw that the hours were until donuts sell out, which was weird (looks like they close on average between 1 & 3). We decided today, on our last day in Vegas to show up right at opening (Thursday btw) we showed up at 6:55 am, we were the 2nd person waiting for them to open (Yes, waiting) the lady in front of us drive from an hour away for a donut for her boyfriend who's bday was today. Before we knew it, 3 more people behind us BEFORE opening. The people behind us also raved about this place. We purchased 3 Triple Chocolate, 2 Cinnamon Sugar Donuts with Whip Topping and FRESH Strawberries, a Strawberry Cheesecake and I personally tried at least a bite of each flavor & loved them all. We also purchased a Homer donut, which I didn't try and was told it was a little dry..but it's not my cup of tea anyway..lol. My husband tried an Apple fritter which he loved so much that he texted me while at work to let me know he loved it. I have a nutella donut saved for tomorrow's breakfast and can't wait!! I was told that they do not make the same flavors daily, which is pretty cool and probably a bummer at the same time..but definitely a good reason to come early!! The lady behind the counter was friendly and knowledgeable, quick and patient with us indecisive customers which was greatly appreciated. I had been recommended the Horchata donut but was told they only make those at the San Diego location. Sounds like I'll have to make a trip, lol.

We got a wide selection of items: chocolate almond croissant, pain au raisin, strawberry croissant, chocolate croissant, beignet, pecan roll, and a few others that I can't remember. The only things that I really liked were the strawberry croissant that had a streusel on top and the beignet. I thought everything else tasted a little dry. BTW the latte was really good. Overall the prices weren't bad considering you're inside a casino in Vegas and everything is more expensive. I thought the majority of the pastries were better than average but not as good as any basic pastry shop in a Paris train stop. I don't think I would go out of my way to stop there, but would stop if it was on my way. Frankly the croissant shop around the corner from my house makes a lighter, fluffier and tastier croissant, but their coffee sucks. After reading some if the other posts, I wish I would have gotten a macaroon but I couldn't justify paying $3.50 for one.

I had a small Almond Buttercrunch ice cream which was terrific and really hit the spot. I could really tell that they used only the best and freshest ingredients because the taste was much better than Baskin Robins or Cold Stone ice cream. My fiance got a small fruit flavored yogurt or sorbet (I forget which) and it was amazing. It was light and tasty and you could definitely tell that it was made with fresh fruit. The place wasn't too busy and the workers (I think they were the owners) were very friendly and helpful. At about $3 for a very small cup it is pretty pricey, but no doubt worth it. I will hopefully be back soon to sample some of their other flavors. My only regrets are that I didn't sample more of the 'exotic' flavors and that I didn't use one of their ice cream sticks made from birch wood to eat my ice cream.

My advice, plan on sharing.",4,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive

"I mean, it's a Christina Tosi storefront! In the Cosmopolitan in LV for goodness sake. I love her and her appearances on Master Chef have always made me happy...but come on Christina. This is not the best effort. Cookies are available for $4 each. I was thrilled to receive a large tin of cookies from Milk Bar for Christmas this year from a co-worker so was excited to go to an actual storefront location. The birthday cake shake was absolutely brilliant and I couldn't force it down my gullet fast enough. Get it! The cookies were disappointing. The blueberry creme cookie tasted artificial and had a sort of chemical aftertaste. The compost cookie at this location was far drier than the same that I received in the tin for Christmas. The corn cookie was quite good though. Overall, Meh... the milkshake was far and away the best thing. The rest isn't worth the impending diabetes.",3,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
Hands down the best ice cream you'll ever eat. It is made in small batches and a wide variety of flavors. Try a dough-melt. Their version of an ice cream sandwich is in a hot glazed donut.

"Prerequisite: Watch Christina Tosi's episode on Chef's Table (Season 4, episode 1). This episode focuses on her passion for baking and how it ties in to Milk Bar, her business. She also goes into detail her inspirations behind her most well-known and beloved creations. CONCEPT: Coming from at least two generations of passionate home bakers, Christina Tosi realized that in lieu of a regular 9-5 job after college she wanted to pursue baking. She moved to NYC with inital dreams of becoming a pastry chef. While working at wd~50 she realized that she most enjoyed baking the simple desserts of her childhood becoming a pastry chef would not accomplish that goal. An introduction to Momofuku's David Chang would change her life forever as it was through this partnership her dreams would come true. Milk Bar is her dreams realized as an actual business. It became so successful that not only has it spread outside NY and lately proceeded westward, it has succeed on its own without Momofuku's influence (it eventually dropped the ""Momofuku"" part of its name in 2012). LOCATION: 2nd floor inside Cosmopolitan, literally next to Momofuku. There are four signature desserts to try at Milk Bar. 1. COOKIES - one of her favorite things to bake from childhood. Six cookie flavors and at least two gluten free/dairy cookies are available ($4) Compost: The signature cookie of her cookie line. Tosi fashioned these cookies from her favorite cookie toppings: chocolate and butterscotch chips, salted pretzels, potato chips, graham crackers and coffee grounds. What makes this cookie special are the toppings, a heavenly mixture of sweet and salty. Though they are good, compost cookies are best enjoyed when freshly made. When you buy them prepackaged they lose some of their magic because it's hard and thick. Do yourself a favor and buy the mix or learn how to make them. It's a labor of love but you'll get a much better cookie because of it AND you get to mix your own ingredients! Corn: This is actually my favorite cookie of the bunch because it tastes like cornbread as a cookie. Actually considered a cult favorite. I like this straight out of the bag. Chocolate Chocolate: A salted brownie as a cookie. Best served warm and with milk. 2. BIRTHDAY CAKE - by the 6"" whole ($55), slice ($14) or 3 truffles ($6.75). Tosi's diatribe on Chef's Table explains why this cake is made the way it is. She is much more interested in examining individual components of a cake, its textures and flavors as well as how they work as a whole. Making a cake look good by covering it with fondant or frosting is simply unnecessary as she would rather have a continuous glimpse inside. Hence when you buy birthday cake by the whole or the slice you won't see any frosting on the side and when you buy the truffles they aren't coated. The frosting is sweet and the cake is spongy. Small versions of the truffle decorate the top of the cake. If you buy a slice it lasts 1-2 days but it's best as long as the cake doesn't dry out. 3. CRACK PIE - bought as slice ($6.50) or whole ($52). This is a modern take on chess pie, a pie made for the occasion when you had almost nothing in your pantry used to make pie. She made crack pie as an accident during her stint at wd~50 making family meal. Everyone raved about this so much that they requested this every time during family meal. When Milk Bar opened she was able to serve this to a wider audience. Crack Pie is unique in the sense that it only has six major ingredients: eggs, butter, heavy cream sugar, vanilla and oat cookie, which serves as the crust. It is dense in the center due to the concentration of eggs and cream. I prefer this over a slice of Birthday Cake as it travels better (it has a smaller box if ordered individually) and there's more flavor in a single slice. It also helps that I love custard and its variants. 4. CEREAL MILK's variants. During her stint at Momofuku Ko David Chang pressured her to create a dessert to end the multi-course meal as previous dessert iterations were merely an afterthought. While on a trip to a bodega she found inspiration in a cereal aisle and used cereal milk initially on panna cotta. Chang loved it and it became a regular feature on Ko's menu. Nowadays this cereal milk can be found as soft serve (most common) or as a milkshake (personal preference) and goes especially well with cornflake topping. Didn't try the soft serve but I got to try all 3 of their shakes. There was nothing too special about cereal milk as it was almost flavorless. Birthday cake was slightly better but I prefer birthday cake as a cake. I did enjoy the chocolate malt cake as I like malt shakes. It was made even better due to the addition of the cornflake topping. As of this writing this is Milk Bar's most western outpost. Subsequent trips to Vegas I'll try to include a Milk Bar stop if at all possible.",4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

When I moved to Charlotte from Chicago. I never knew how much baked goods meant to me. Until I visited AmÃ©lie's... This is the third location I've visited. I love how the quality has remained the same through out. The first time I went was with a friend who raved about their macaroons. I had to try it. I'm now addicted. I try them everywhere I go. AmÃ©lie's has the best macaroons IMO. Their iced coffees are strong. On one of my visits with my friend we opted to have caramel added to our remade drinks because it was almost on the bitter side. Which leads me into customer service. They treat you real good here. They are willing to go through flavors and heating up your treats when needed. I see why people of all ages and walks of life can be found here. The relaxing atmosphere and the bomb treats. AmÃ©lie's is a must when you're in Charlotte. I haven't tried their other baked goods but my friends say their awesome. Please check them out if you're looking for a treat...or two!,5,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown
"I love this place! Right by my house so I am always here for $2.50 Tuesdays!! So far I've had the Nutella & Hazelnut, green tea, pistachio, and NY cheesecake. Everything is made fresh onsite and is well worth the wait if you happen to stop by during a busy hour. Prices are affordable and they work quickly to make sure everyone is satisfied. They even apologize if it takes a bit long if they are making a fresh batch, which is much appreciated and nothing to be sorry for!

"I really wanted to like this place. I MEAN really, really wanted to be a raging fan just like everyone else but honestly, it's all hype to me. Located on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan, the Milk Bar has located next to Momofuku. I have visited Milk Bar on many occasions and have tried a variety of different desserts. I have had the birthday cake, soft serve cereal milk, a milk shake, the infamous crack pie, and all of the cookies (blueberry, compost, cornflake)-- but none of them were impressive. I have gifted the cookies to my family when I went home to visit, and even they were underwhelmed by the taste and the quality. The cookies were dry and flavorless. For the price of the cookie gift set, I was hoping for at least one winner in batch but none of them were THAT memorable. The birthday cake was good but other than it being cute it was pretty much funfetti cake mix (yeah, I'm sorry but I just had to say it). The crack pie was something that I thought that I would like, but meh. It tasted just okay and the oil seeping through the packaging wasn't very appetizing. Maybe it is because the items here at the Milk Bar come at a premium price and the quality just doesn't match? Either way, I found myself disappointed visit after visit. Milk Bar will survive in Vegas because of its reputation and tourists will keep on coming to get those Instagram likes but I don't see locals going out of their way to give this place a return visit. I still have hope that the one in New York will win my foodie heart over. See, I told you I really wanted to like this place.",3,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Restaurant review Frozen custard, just what you need on a hot summer day. This place is a real gem with the low cost ice cream that puts to shame other ice cream stores. Do you know what makes custard a custard and not ice cream, it contains egg yolk in it. Just a random fact for the day. This place is always busy in the summer time with your selection of waffle cone ice cream, sundaes, snowstorms, and shakes. The ice cream ""custard"" is super smooth. Flavors are usually limited to vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, and the special for the day. But you can have a lot of different mix-in to make your own snow storm. You can eat right outside the benches or drive through. All and all this place is simply amazing! Pro: inexpensive ice cream ""custard"", fast service Cons: only open during the summer, credit card can only be used if you are purchasing 10 dollars or more Hidden gem: Snowstorm card, for every 9 you buy you get one free",5,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive

"I was so excited to go here, but that excitement soon turned to disappointment. We had never been to a Carlo's Bakery in person, and we are fans of Buddy, of course, so we had to go while in Vegas. We waited in a decently long line, which gave us time to look at all the things that were wrong with this place. The display cases were filthy and messy. Frosting, sprinkles and crumbs were everywhere. There were even some cupcakes that had fallen upside down that just laid there in the case looking oh so sad. Several of the trays were empty, one of those being cannolis. One of the main reasons we wanted to go to Carlo's was was to try one of their famous cannolis. Sadly, that didn't happen. Mind you this was in the middle of the day. It wasn't like we were there 10 minutes til close. On top of that the food that was in the case was not properly labeled. Many things had no labels at all. This can be dangerous for folks with food allergies and annoying to other people trying to communicate what they want to the workers. We ended up getting a lobster tail and a napoleon type thing (a layered cake. no sign, so who knows what it was!). The lobster tails tasted stale and like it had sat in a fridge for a week. The cake thing was just not good. The flavor was not good. I took one bite of each and wished I had spent that $20 on a slot machine instead of desserts that wal-mart can do better than. I really hope Buddy and his family get a handle on things and get their locations back in shape, because I don't think this is the quality they had in mind for their customers.",1,Negative,Negative,Negative,unknown,Negative,unknown,Negative,unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown

I got the blueberry and cream cookie and the chocolate birthday truffle. It was solid. I was a little disappointed about how they came prepackaged instead of fresh out of the oven; but it is what it is. The desserts were still yummy and chewy and decadent and hit the spot, but I'm assuming it wasn't the best of the best as it wasn't the OG or another flagship store.

It was on our way home and looked really interesting, so I took my fiancÃ© there. The decor is not much different than most indie ice cream/gelato shops. It was comfortable and friendly. The staff was fantastic. They answered our questions with smiles, made recommendations, and the man who we can only imagine was the owner, came out to check and make sure everything was good. After tasting a few flavors, my fiancÃ© had the blueberry muffin ice cream with graham cracker crumbs and red velvet macaroons, but does not like marshmallow so stopped there. I was trying to stay non-dairy so I had the chocolate sorbet with red velvet macaroons and a toasted marshmallow. All I can say is, we did not leave a single drop or crumb. When the owner came out and asked my fiance how the ice cream was, all my fiance could say was ""Gone!"" The ice cream is obviously freshly made daily, as well as the macaroons. They were very fresh.

We got the St. Pat's Day Lucky Charms macaron ice cream sandwich and the strawberry shortcake yum-ee bun. The ice cream sandwich macaron was amazing. Everything about it was perfect. The cereal in the outside added good flavor to the ice cream, the macaron was delicious, and the sauce was the perfect complement. It was huge, so I had to bite the top and bottom halves separately. The yum-ee bun was good, but it felt like the portions were off. Most bites all I tasted was strawberry ice cream, which was disappointing. They said this was their most popular item which surprised me because I thought the macaron was better. They also make cereal milkshakes and cookie dough pops which I would love to come back and try.

The tea was so yummy! Actually, everything was yummy! I shared all those sweets, though, of course. The chocolate mousse cup is definitely for chocolate lovers. The cup itself is made of chocolate. Very rich! The chocolate cake is on the lighter chocolate side and fluffy. I liked that the macarons were a good size, not like other places whose are so small that it isn't worth it. Each seemed true to flavor, and the cookie part was just right, not crunchy but not too chewy either.

Not your typical flavors, most of the time they have various vegan flavors, exotic fruit and unconventional mixups that you would not expect.

Salty caramel, maple bacon, german chocolate, sundae, pumpkin & raspberry... They taste great and look amazing, really a couple of cuts above the average doughnut. I love that the place looks like your average hole in the wall, mom & pop place, not some fufu fancy joint.

"Meh is just the word. We are Las Vegas locals. I have been here once before and had an OK experience then as well. The first time we came rather late, there was a very minimal selection. We chalked it up to how late in the evening we arrived. On our recent second visit we came at a decent time mid-day. It was the same scenario, barely a selection. The macaroons are OK. We got the Salted Caramel, Vanilla and Chocolate. One of them was really stale and hard to bite in unfortunately. The texture is on point, but sadly the taste just isn't there. They all tasted very similar, with not munch of difference in flavor. We also got the Chocolate and Vanilla eclair-(Pastry and what seems like just whipped cream in the middle). Also again very disappointing. I by no means a food snob. But I felt for the price and size, I was really missing out. The staff was friendly, however we were over charged by $10. There were quite a few people and they were busy. We didn't have a receipt (our mistake). So we just made a note to never come back. Real downer, but if I were you.

"I stopped by Sinful Sweets this past Thurs. at 7pm. I'd had Sinful Sweets bookmarked for a long while, but this was the first time I received the chance to stop by, given that they close at 8pm. Usually, if I'm downtown at this time, I'm headed to a show in the Cultural District, and am not quite ready for dessert yet. This time, however, I was headed back from a vigorous paddle at Kayak PGH, which allowed me to justify stopping by to indulge myself. In checking out the reviews beforehand, it seemed that the most popular items at Sinful Sweets are milkshakes and cake pops. Upon perusing the display case, there were surprisingly few cake pops left, so I decided to go with a milkshake ($5). The guy working (probably the owner) told me that the price included one mix-in (others are extra), and that I could have my milkshake made from two different types of ice cream if I wanted. After perusing the options, I ordered a milkshake with chocolate and cannoli ice cream with Andes pieces as a mix-in. My custom milkshake turned out to be a delectable creation. Its size and thickness were comparable to those of milkshakes from the Milkshake Factory, and the cannoli ice cream lent a nice creaminess to it in combination with the chocolate ice cream. Numerous small chocolate chips from the cannoli ice cream, as well as the Andes pieces, lent textural interest to the milkshake, culminating in a delicious pile of candy at the bottom of the cup for a sweet finish. Although Sinful Sweets doesn't stock as many different ice cream flavors as the Milkshake Factory, their milkshakes are more customizable if you account for the ability to mix flavors and the candy mix-ins, and they use the same brand of ice cream (Perry's). As was mentioned in a relatively recent review, I didn't receive a chocolate dipped straw, so perhaps they've stopped the practice of dipping straws in chocolate (I didn't ask). In addition to my milkshake, I received a dark chocolate dipped pretzel for checking in on Yelp. This was a nice bonus, esp. since I accidentally left behind some chocolate peanut butter dipped pretzels that I purchased last weekend at my parents' place, which were promptly devoured by my dad before I could ask my parents to ship them to me. :-( Overall, I was quite pleased with my visit to Sinful Sweets. Service was friendly, and the price of the milkshake was right in line with the Milkshake Factory. As others have mentioned, they have a daily milkshake happy hour during weekdays from 4-6pm (25% off), so if you're able to take advantage of it, you can get a milkshake for even less money. While I was very pleased with my milkshake, I'm not awarding a full five stars because of the lack of cake pops (I heard the owner explain to another customer that they were sold out because someone had made a large purchase of them earlier). However, this could be a good thing, as it gives me motivation to return and update my review! 4.5 stars.",4,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Yum yum YUM!! As a donut fanatic I had heard a lot of hype around the vegan doughnut company well before I went in for my first visit. My friends and I planned to show up right at opening time (9 am) on a beautiful Sunday morning -- and when we got there the line was already AROUND THE BLOCK. We waited in line for ~40 minutes, but the moment we got inside, we knew the wait was worth it. All their donuts were beautifully decorated and consisted of more traditional flavors, but also, more unique ones. We ordered a box consisting of strawberry cream, cookies & cream, lemon lavender, maple cream, and more! They were all SO GOOOD-- the donuts were delicious, weren't too overly sweet, and I couldn't even tell that they were vegan. My favorite flavor was the lemon lavendar because it was a nice combination of tart + sweet. So before you go, make sure to double check their hours since they are pretty limited (and you should definitely try to show up early so the donut flavors you want don't run out). In addition, their menu is always changing, so you should look at their website or instagram page too for those! Fun fact: The two co-founders attended the same high school I went to in the Cleveland area, so that pretty awesome! Will definitely continue supporting them and am excited to see their business continue to grow",5,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown

I love all things sugary and I enjoy baking as well as discovering all wonderful bakeries. These cupcakes had a simple presentation.

It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. The frosting was very sugary.. like hard-shell. Maybe I will try the ice cream next time. The location is nice though. Picked up the cupcakes here.

I don't even remember where I heard about it but it's been in the back of my mind since then. I even made a copycat Crack Pie recipe that won a pie contest and was AMAZING. So I just HAD to try the real thing! Ugh it was disappointing. I mean the crack pie was okay but I'd rather just have like a $1 candy bar or something. The cereal milk ice cream was interesting at first bite but after that I just didn't want to eat it anymore, and that's not like me to stop eating ice cream. I couldn't finish it.

"I wish I could give Bouchon Bakery a better review, especially after our ecstatic meal at Bouchon the night before, but it sorta sucked. I like the cute little stand hidden away from everything else (just enter the Venetian and keep walking back and back from the casino floor), not a fan of the lack of seating (the food court is just upstairs and down a hallway a bit though). We had vanilla and pistachio macarons and some other small pastry. Macarons were hard on the outside and the filling was cloying- they'd been sitting for too long, perhaps? Big, which is nice, but ugh, CHEWY. Not a word I want with my lighter than air cookies. Two stars because I have hopes and I really did enjoy Bouchon.

Today being hot and humid required a lovely melting cone of chocolate pecan one of my favorite flavors. Handel's has been around since 1945 and makes their ice cream fresh in the store and they hail from Ohio. They have cones, cups, sandwiches, and pops so get your ice cream the way you want it. You can also order pints to go of your fav flavors. Even with Covid19 still on the prowl, this location is all about being outside with social distancing!

But, I just can't bring myself to give more than three stars because I have to believe that their process for preparing food orders is just too inefficient and can be faster than it is.

"Batch Bakehouse is baking with magic I think... Corey D took me here as the last stop in Madison before I hopped on a plane back to Denver. I saw a dark chocolate and peanut butter loaf that I absolutely knew Sir Nicholas would love so I decided to purchase it and take it home with me. I carted a box of baked goods through security, stepped onto the plane and gingerly places it in the overhead (I was sitting in the first row, otherwise I would have put it under my seat.) Through all of this travel the loaf remained in perfect condition. I brought it home to Sir Nicholas and Little Man E would both took bites and make various sounds of approval. In Nick's case it was something like, ""man, this is sooo good!"" while Ephraim took a bite, giggled maniacally and took off down the hallway with as big a piece as he could hold. Trust me, after my bite I understood the desire to hoard it all for himself. And even after leaving it out overnight (still in the box, but otherwise unprotected, this cake remained soft, moist, and delicious. I also shared a chocolate/chocolate cookie with Corey that was mouthwatering and a piece of lemon cake that was perfect. I am very lucky that Batch is in Madison and not Denver.

"Please visit this place! It's nestled in a corner off a busy street, so it's kind of easy to miss. Not only was the service amazing, the ice cream was too. We were actually the first customers of the day a couple days ago, as we got there exactly at noon when they opened. We saw two more people throughout the time it took for us to decide what we were getting, place our order, receive our order, and get back in the car to cool down, which was really only about 5-6 minutes. Seemed like a pretty popular spot. The cashier who helped us was extremely helpful, patient, and friendly. She let me try two flavors I was in between: the taro and honey lavender. Both of those flavors were delicious and fresh, but I couldn't pass up the Taro! My bf got the Elvis (peanut butter, banana, and bacon. Are you kidding?) flavor. They have what's called a Dough Melt which is a lightly glazed donut stuffed with an ice cream flavor and includes one topping of your choice like Fruity Pebbles, Reese's puffs, Cocoa Pebbles, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, sprinkles, etc. If you've ever been to Afters Ice Cream, it's similar to their ""Milky Bun"", but the Dough Melt from Novel was much better and fresher tasting. The price for two dough melts was $11.95, so a little less than $6 per dough melt, which is pretty reasonable for gourmet-tasting ice cream. I was glad they weren't overpriced like some of the other ice cream spots around. The lady preparing our Dough Melts was also really nice and patient. Another thing I noticed was how they were properly using gloves when handling food, and they both properly wore their masks. During these times, those things matter, and it just added to the overall great experience. We'll definitely be back when we're in Phoenix again!",5,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"CRACK PIE | Smaller than I thought it would be for $6. It was definitely good, but I don't think I'd buy it again and I don't think I'd have enjoyed it as much if my friend hadn't hyped it up for me. I'm afraid I can't justify the size for its price. It came in a envelope box, given at the register. CEREAL SHAKE | $10? (Not certain, because I didn't purchase it myself) Definitely a heavy drink with all the milk, but I couldn't stop drinking it. The cereal was perfectly crunchy throughout, even at the bottom of the cup. I'd get it again, but only to share with someone. (Shared with my boyfriend) EXPERIENCE | Small line when I went around midnight on a weekday, but it went by quick and we didn't wait long for the shake to come out. Cute photo op with a pink ""milk"" light stand in front, but it's low to the ground which might make it difficult to get an easy shot. Overall, I'd come back to try the other items but based on the price point, I'd prefer to make it an ""experience"" dessert by sharing with my boyfriend or friends to diffuse the cost. Originally wanted to give 3 stars but if I've enjoyed the experience or food enough to want to come back, it's at least a 4.

"Red Velvet cupcakes are my kryptonite so obviously I had to check out Sprinkles as soon as I got to town... literally. Two Red Velvet cupcakes, and a mini Red Velvet later, I'm ready to give me review.... They were good, really good, but not the best. The regular sized ones were maybe a little dry (but not so dry as to stop me from eating a dozen more...) so if I'd paid for them (more on that in a minute) I may have been disappointed but probably not because it's still a dang good cupcake. The mini one I had, however, was bite sized perfection. If you're not a Red Velvet person, they have tons of other flavors which I should probably try sometime - I mean after all, I've never met a cupcake I didn't like. Beyond the traditional vanilla and chocolate, they bake up specialty flavors that vary depending on the day including Banana Peanut Butter (!), Chocolate Coconut, Cuban Coffee, Carrot, Strawberry, Cinnamon Sugar AND SO MANY MORE!!! Plus, they have seasonal ones like Pumpkin and for the month of May they are doing a special Margarita flavored cupcake. They sell the mini cupcakes for $2/each and the regular ones for $3.75 each. If you think that's too pricey sign up for the Sprinkles Perks program online (it's free) and just like that they will give you a FREE CUPCAKE! Then, they'll give you another one for your birthday. Just make sure to sign up for the program around when you'll be able to go because the free cupcakes do expire. If you're looking for something sweet and are a cupcake lover then you've got to check out Sprinkles. It's located on the Linq Promenade so it's not terribly convenient if you're staying anywhere other than Linq, Flamingo, or Caesars, but with that delicious cupcake waiting, it's definitely worth the walk!

"I haven't actually been to this place, but Iris C. was nice enough to bring me back a macaron gift box. According to her, this is just a small kiosk so there wouldn't be that much to try anyway. But, back to the macarons. In my limited experience as a macaron connoisseur, they have all been bite-sized - no bigger than the size of a half dollar coin. These macarons are supersized! They seem like a novelty item. The bigger size does not take away from the consistency of having a crispy shell with a soft and chewy inside. How do these compare with Paulette's, which have become the standard for good macarons? The texture is definitely there, but the flavors still go to Paulette's. The flavors are limited to: chocolate, raspberry, orange, lemon, espresso, and vanilla - good, but not amazing. Make me a giant almond-flavored macaron and you will get your 5th star. Oh, these macarons are not cheap by the way. One big MoonPie-sized macaron will cost you around $3.50.

With two hours before the flight, we quickly walked through the canal shops where we waited in a not too long line. That was the first thing that made me happy. I HATE waiting.

"Sweet republic - hands down, it is delicious and good. Get the toffee banofi - leave the place with a full belly, happy. :) Toffee Banofi - Delicious! Sometimes when I get sundaes, they either have too much syrup, ice cream, whipped cream, etc but it's perfect. All the little pieces in the sundae is just delicious. I love the little toppings on top, it's so good. I died and went to heaven. I give this place 4 stars because for $8, I thought the item would be bigger. However, it's a good size - not too much to cause diabetes or too little to leave me hungry. Plus, we shouldn't eat too much ice cream, we don't want to be part of the diabetes epidemic in US but it's soo hard when ice cream is a food we can die for -- we can stand in the middle of the road and eat ice cream in awe as the cars go by us. :) I went during the afternoon on Sunday. I came when it was slightly busy. The wait can be long if the line is long because there's only two people and they help each person at a time but they provide good service overall! :)",4,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"Page's is a Pittsburgh ICON. I've been eating their ice cream since before I could walk or talk. The creamy cones are synonymous with summer in Pittsburgh. During the summer, you can expect to wait to get your dessert from Page's, but it's always worth it. They have such a huge selection to choose from, most using their thick soft serve as a starting point. Personally, I find it refreshing from time to time to order just a vanilla soft serve cone. Get back to basics and really enjoy the extra cream that they stir into their mix. I do recommend the dirt sundae. It was my go-to growing up. What's better than finding a rock hard gummy worm nestled into your crunched up Oreo's?? Aside from ice cream, Page's also serves a small menu of hot food. I can remember stopping by during the day with my gramma to get a 35 cent cheeseburger. They are always made fresh on their grill inside next to the banana split station (odd combo, I know.) I was ALWAYs tempted to get the nacho's because you can see them from the ordering window, but always had stage fright going up to that little window. Page's has been around for decades, and it's clear that it will be around for decades longer. If you're looking for an authentic Pittsburgh experience, it always ends with a cone from Page's!",5,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive
"Thank the Lord for Fatty Daddy's. My family's dinner plans did not turn out as great as I was hoping for and figured lets try one last spot to save the night. Fatty Daddy's was the hero. This hidden gem offers great homemade ice cream selections, macaroons (yep, that's what I said), along with burnt marshmallow yumminess. For my treat, I ordered the cookie sundae (there may have been a name for it I can not remember). With it came two scoops, a macaroon, and marshmallow. For my ice cream scoops I rolled with Nutella and fruity pebbles. The Nutella tasted like a Wendy's chocolate frosty and the fruity pebbles tasted, well, like fruity pebbles. Both were so good. I went with the fruity pebbles macaroon that was so chewy and flavorful. As for the marshmallow, not sure if it is homemade but it sure tastes like it. The whole treat was a winner for sure. The establishment was very comfortable with inside and outside seating and the young lady who prepared our treats was very friendly. She offered free samples for all who asked.

So I must give a big UPS to my fellow Yelpers. Without you I would be parisienne macaroon-less and my oh my I adore my french macaroons. I used to work in a restaurant that made these delicate cookies as petit fours. I've been addicted ever since. Bouchon Bakery is in the Venetian right underneath the escalator (if coming from self parking) next to the Apothecary. They close early sometimes depending on how busy they are. The 1st time I tried to go here they were shutting down at 10pm to my dismay. The macaroons here are HUGE and the price tag is $3.59 a piece. I got the seven pack for (I'm embarrassed to say) $17.29 and a cappuchino to boot. My mama opted for their chai tea and the apple fritter croissant with almond creme. That croissant was delish and even though I'm not a huge croissant fan (after you've made them once its hard to eat that much butter knowingly) I snuck a bite or two of this. I haven't made it all the way through my box yet but so far the chocolate has been the best. The texture of the macaroons is right on point! But the macaroons will only last (at the most) a week after you buy them if you keep them in the refrigerator the entire time (warns the staff). I really wish they labeled the flavors in the box :(.,5,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown
"I was underwhelmed by my experience at Jeni's and so were my family members. First of all, the line is incredibly frustrating to wait in. It was hot and service was slow. I know scooping ice cream takes time, but for the time it took, it was not worth it. My husband and I both sampled several flavors and did not like many of them. My husband said that both chocolate flavors he tasted had bizarre aftertastes. I tried vanilla and honey and didn't taste any honey. I did end up getting cream puff flavor which was fine, but nothing to crave or rave about. The flavors have the illusion of being interesting, but are not great flavors. This, of course, is just my opinion. But I feel the appeal is in the boutique shop style and reputation rather than actual quality. We also felt it was far too overpriced for what you get. I much prefer Golden Cow Creamery down the road. I have no reason to revisit Jeni's again when there are better ice cream shops in Charlotte.",3,Negative,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown

I met a friend to try a new pizza place and Somi Somi was only two doors down so we stopped for dessert. So easy to find right off of Eastern Avenue. Somi Somi is a special Korean dessert that is known is Ah Boong. First you decide how you wish to eat your Somi Somi. I chose upside down Ah Boong. It is served in a fish shape waffle cone. Next you select a soft serve flavor. I chose Matcha. Then you choose a filling. I decided on Taro. Lastly you may also select a topping of cereal bites, coconut, strawberry etc. I have been back several times now and almost always order my dessert now with Ube soft serve, Nutella filling and a different topping each time. This is one of the most refreshing and tasty desserts I had all summer. Their soft serve is so creamy and packs plenty of flavor. The homemade waffle cone is soft and flavorful especially with Nutella. Warning, the servings are large so you can probably share one with whomever you are with.

There are more empty shelves than there is bread/ pastries. Everybody's grabbing whatever's being put before they even hit the shelves like it was going out of style. The pastries are delicious.

"I am a sucker for French macarons. I go to Bouchon every time I'm in Las Vegas, Yountville or Beverly Hills. No matter the wait, it's always worth it. Here's what I ordered: Grilled Cheese Sandwich - No, I didn't come here to buy a grilled cheese sandwich. I was just starving so I wanted something small to hold me over until dinner time... plus, I'll never turn away from a grilled cheese. Note: They have to ""heat up"" the oven and that took ten minutes. What I really liked most about their grilled cheese sandwich was that it wasn't greasy! What I didn't understand was why they call it a grilled cheese if it's not grilled, they put it in the oven to melt the cheese. Anyway, I enjoyed it nonetheless. French Macarons - Yes, this was what I came here for!! I'm drooling thinking about Macarons as I write this. The Macarons here are bigger than the average size Macarons you buy anywhere else. I always get the Pistachio because it's my absolute favorite flavor. I also got the chocolate, vanilla, and their seasonal flavor; blueberry cheesecake. They're so light, fluffy and perfect.

My boyfriend and I landed in Vegas on a Saturday morning and headed straight to Donut Bar at 8am hoping for some fresh donuts. We got there around 830AM & there was no line when we walked in. The second we entered, the room filled with sweet smelling goodness. All the donuts LOOKED AMAZING. We bought 2 dozen for our entire group of friends. So we basically tried every single Donut they had to offer. And I mean I actually tried a bite of every single one.. and I wasn't too amazed. Maybe I was just overhyped? The price was pretty high too. The doughnuts are HUGE.. But bigger is not always better. They ranged from $2-5 depending on which flavor. We ended up spending about $75 for 2 dozen.

"Only two stars, because the fact is that yes, I have experienced better than the pastries at the Las Vegas Bouchon Bakery. The best of what I sampled was the chocolate croissant: it had two ribbons of chocolate in it, which was quite nice. However, the pastry was just a bit too tough when it should have been tender, and it was too greasy. I also took tastes of four different macaron flavors: chocolate, vanilla, raspberry and lemon. The chocolate was far and away the best of the four, but it was more like a brownie than a macaron. The weakest were the raspberry and lemon, which had too much oozy filling. Worst of what I tried: the pain au raisin. Pain au raisin is supposed to be a custard raisin roll, not a raisin danish. Flat, extremely greasy... I will only grudgingly acknowledge that there were enough raisins and that they were soft and tender, but that couldn't salvage the thing. I don't know, maybe I'm holding this place to unfairly high standards, but I know that pastry can be better.",2,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"I've always wanted to try Milk Bar, at least the one in NY whenever I make my way there, but when I found out there was one in Vegas I had to stop by. I've tried their cookies when they've been mailed to me as a gift but I honestly should've tried the same cookies there to compare if it tasted even better from the source, next time I will! But I ended up ordering their Milk Bar Pie slice (i believe it was formerly known as their crack pie). I was sorta disappointed with how much smaller the slice was in what looked like a big enough container that definitely could've fit a much larger slice of pie, but ya know, it is Vegas. Therefore prices will be much higher for what you actually get. It was like close to $8 for the slice I got! However despite the price, their Milk Bar Pie was SO good. It had this flavor combo of sweetness and saltiness that I wished I had more of it. So I was at least impressed with what I got. My mom really wanted to try their red velvet soft serve but their soft serve machines were not working that day so that was another disappointment.

The ice cream was creamy and genuinely flavorful from the first spoonful to the last. The toppings were generous and equally fresh and flavorful.

The same person who takes the order, makes the order. There are only 4 people working here and the lines are back to the street. The counter person takes the order, walk toward the back with no sense of urgency, slowly fills the cup, talks to his co-worker for 30 seconds, goes to the topping area, same indifference to the 70-100 people in line, finally gets back to he counter and ask the same person what they want next (God forbid he could've made 2 at the same time). The owners couldn't care less that there far better ways to do things. Hire 3 more people. One person, takes orders and money, another makes the order. The time would be cut b 30%. And here's another idea, the teenage workers should actually be managed, Hurry just a little, don't talk to your co-workers, if one of your friends comes to the window, don't spend 3 mi asking about his life etc. CARE ABOUT THE CUSTOMER. But the owner clearly doesn't care about his customers because they wait and wait and wait. Except for one.

They will not let you order the soft serve on the cone and the only way you can get the cone is to pay $2 more to have them put it in upside down in a cup. They also did not have the cold brew float.,1,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"Best coconut cupcake I've ever had. Great Strawberry, carrot cake, and chocolate cupcakes as well.

"While I'd like to think I'm pretty good at bringing back souvenirs and snacks from my travels, that's definitely not the case when it comes to my trips to Vegas. Perhaps it's because I seem to be there so often, but it never crosses my mind to bring stuff back. Not that there are a ton of good choices anyways - a Fat Tuesday yard stick/cup? Some cheesy t-shirt? A WIFE?! HA. Thank goodness for Milk Bar and all of their cookies! As you could imagine for obvious reasons, this Milk Bar is just SLIGHTLY different than the original one in NY; the second floor of Cosmo versus a tiny shop in the East Village? Yeah, that's different. However, despite being set in very different places, they're essentially the same in the most important way of all - their goodies! Whether it's their cookies, shakes (both regular and boozy), cakes, soft serve, or their famed Crack Pies, you're bound to find something for your sweet tooth! The first time I stopped by Milk Bar, it was strictly to pick up some of their cookies that I found oh so tasty when I had them in NY. The range of choices seemed to be about the same (Confetti, Blueberry & Cream, Corn, Cornflake Chocolate Chip Marshmallow, Chocolate-Chocolate, and their famous Compost cookie), but, more importantly, they tasted just as good. Of the bunch, the Cornflake Chocolate Chip Marshmallow and Compost cookies were my favorites - SO DELICIOUS! Along with getting more of their cookies, I also decided to try their GRASSHOPPER MILKSHAKE the last time I stopped by here. It had never been high on my list of things to get here, but my friend couldn't stop raving about the one he tried (which says something). While I can't say how mine compared to his, I thought my shake was pretty solid. The flavor could've been a little richer, but I liked the texture (not super thick or thin), how great the minty chocolate flavor was, and that it wasn't overly sweet. Even though it lacks the coziness and charm of their original NY spot, I can't say that there's really anything bad about this particular location. In fact, with how well their cookies keep, stopping off here before flying out of Vegas is practically a must! Which hopefully leads to getting a slice of their Crack Pie...or finally trying their Cereal Milk soft serve! Such a fail on my part for still not trying them yet...",4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
I just moved into the neighborhood and found Handel's last week. Let's just say the staff is super friendly and very conscious of long lines. As they opened more windows to serve the guests faster. The ice cream was the best I've ever had. In fact I brought my family back three times last week and took my aunt and her kids there. I found out the company is from Ohio and so am I. Handel's reminded me of the ice cream stands from Ohio. I will always rave about Handel's ice cream. It will be a weekly stop for my family. Oh and the cones are sky high!!,5,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive
"Since watching Chef's Table I have been clamoring to try Milk Bar in NY, but won't be going for a few months. I was surprised and excited to wander by this one in LV. I do not have a big sweet tooth but was intrigued by Chef Christina Tosi's innovation and passion as portrayed on Chef's Table. I decided to try the ICED CEREAL MILK LATTE and it was sooo good. The cashier confirmed it was not too sweet and she was right. It was not overly sweet but it was amazingly delicious with a slight hint of cereal milk flavor. It was so good I wanted to come back the next day for another one in a larger size.",5,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
This place is one of my favorite weekly go-to spots with my daughter. Staff is super friendly and add to the experience significantly. We try not donuts all the time and have never been disappointed by our choices. All donuts are massive in size and perfect in texture. Fluffy tasty donuts! They recently started doing sugar donuts (plain?) and it's probably my my favorite. It's massive!,5,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive
"There is nothing more gratifying than enjoying a scoop, or two. from Honey Hut on a warm summer day! Buck heck, this ice cream would be a treat even in the dead of winter during a snowstorm. You cannot put a price tag on quality, and that is just what you get here with a unique mix of flavors sweetened with - you guessed it - honey! While there are many great places ice cream destinations throughout Northeast Ohio, Honey Hut easily makes the top five because quality and originality are two ingredients that many other places just don't have, e.g., Dairy Queen, Baskin Robbins.",5,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive

Run. Don't walk. Run. This ice cream is what my dreams are made of. The strawberry rhubarb is amazing...the homemade pie crust pieces...perfection. The cookies and cream is literally the best I've EVER had. I also really like the sizes. I had the tasters duo and it was the perfect size to satisfy my sweet tooth without feeling guilty or weighed down.,5,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"I was debating between a 3 or a 4 star rating, but I went with the 4 because this place was definitely better than a 3. The reason I don't feel that it is a solid 4 is because I felt the selection is very limited. That being said... I loved the decor, the cake I tried was delicious and moist, and the espresso was better than most coffee shops. I will definitely be back, but I hope there will be more options next time.",4,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"I am so sorry Christina Tosi, your dessert bar is just . . .not that great! Christina is one of my favorite celebrity chefs and I love seeing her on tv as well as watching her cooking, her style, pastries, etc just her being a chef! I really wanted to try her place and we came by after lunch for something light for dessert. I saw all the cookie flavors and wanted to try a few but then my eyes caught the spiked milkshakes! So, I opted for the cornflake chocolate chip marshmallow cookie and the White-Russian-Cereal-Milk Shake. The cookie was nothing special . . .and actually, nothing making me want to order it again or try another type of cookie. It was chewy but not a good chewy, and it seems over baked as it was pretty tough. The cornflakes have a very subtle crispness and saltiness, the marshmallow just seems to add sweetness, and the chocolate chips are almost nonexistent. It was just not a great cookie and I expected so much more. As for the milkshake, this was pretty good. The cereal milk flavor is interesting, unique, and pretty tasty! Spiked with the alcohol it becomes a great blend of sweet and . . . umami? Is that the best way to describe a boozy milkshake? I don't know, but it was good! I won't mind trying Milk Bar again, but definitely not the cookies next time.",3,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"I was recommend by a local to come to this location. I'd have to say the quality of service was terrible. I was not greeted. No one standing in line but yet I was rushed. As if I should have known to not ask questions to the cashier. I was confused as the amount of money being charged and asked that she repeat order. And I had to tell her she was adding items from another incoming party. After leaving I reviewed the pastries and bill and still had other charges. I had to return to have them correct it. I purchased 4 chocolate crossiants, eclair, apple turnover, brownie. Perhaps it was an old batch but not impressed with either items. Too dry.",2,Negative,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

Chocolate cannoli to die for and actually not to sweet. My baby sis loves her rainbow cake slice and the lobster tails original and hazelnut ammmaZING! It was my dream to go to Carlo's bakery and get one of each and I did and those were by far my favorite but everything was delicious. My dad loved the hazelnut cookies and lemon ones too. My best friend said her fave was the double chocolate chip cookie and carrot cake. I will definitely be making this my go to stop before we leave.,5,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive
