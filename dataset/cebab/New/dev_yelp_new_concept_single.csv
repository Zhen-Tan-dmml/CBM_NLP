"The ice cream here is definitely tasted, but I think the ice cream is too melted. It has already melt down to my hand even before I went out of the front yard. I prefer something with more solid texture, but if you like soft ice cream, this is definite the place to go.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,3
"What a disappointment! We had dinner in the Venetian and did some walking around and shopping. I always develop a sweet tooth after dinner, we saw the Carlos Bake Shop sign and knew that was our next stop. It was across from Buddy V's Restaurant. The bake shop had a steady flow of customers. Even though it was late there was still a decent selection in the cases. We decided to get Vanilla cupcakes and a Creme Puff. The prices are pretty much on par with most cupcake shops/bakeries in town. The staff was pleasant and helpful. The Creme Puff was very small and pretty average tasting, had more whipped creme in than Bavarian creme. On to the cupcakes. Ugh! I have never refused to finish my cupcake until now! I LOVE cake, but this was horrible. Super dry with no taste, did they forget to add the vanilla?? If a baker can't make a plain vanilla cake then you have no business being a baker. The icing was pretty average but didn't help the cupcake one bit. The other factors in this visit saved them from getting a 1 STAR review. Skip this place if you are craving cake!! I will never go back.",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,2
"So this is one I've been waiting for and I am excited that I get to finally review it. Ambiance: The decor is fairly the same as the ones that I have seen in California. I mean it is a franchise so no surprise there and no complaints. There's a good amount of cases for people to go to when choosing what they want to grab and the line weaves its way through. Service: Now service was good. There was a lot of people when I went so there was a bit of a wait but compared with the amount of people it definitely was not to bad. Service was fairly quick so no complaints. A girl named Kiara was our cashier and she was nice, quick, and when my mom asked if they had Taro bread she kindly offered to grab us a couple before it made its way to the cases which I did appreciate. Food: This is always the highlight. I never have any complaint and this is the same. My personal favorites are the Taro marble bread, egg tarts, and chocolate bread. The taro bread is always nice and subtle. Chocolate bread was good with some powder sugar on the top. The egg tarts are always a big one for me because the crust is always so flakey and the filling is sweet. A new favorite I've come to add is if you're looking for something on the savory side their Kale spinach danish definitely make my tummy happy. Overall, I'm glad we finally have one in our city. Only thing that I wasn't pleased with was the wait just because if you've been to other 85's then you know they're pretty quick but I'm sure they'll get faster once they fully settle in. In love and will be coming here a lot more in the future!",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"I have pretty high standards for cupcakes, as a friend owns her own cupcake business and hers are second to none. I've also had not-so-good cupcakes at another Sprinkles, so I was half hesitant to try this location. I'm glad I did. They really redeemed themselves. The last one I had was dry with hard icing. I had a pumpkin cupcake at this one and it was moist (sorry, moist-o-phobes) and the frosting, though thin, was rich. The flavor was spot on. While it wasn't nearly as good as the ones my friend makes, it was worth what I paid for it and it made up for bad experiences in the past. My husband had the chocolate marshmallow and said his was great as well, but his taste buds also might not be as discerning as mine! While it's not a necessity to stop here in Vegas, it was nice to have at the end of the night for a little sweet treat.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"Omg! This place is all of my sweet tooth cravings come true! I literally stared at the menu for about 5 minutes because I couldn't narrow down what I wanted- i wanted a little bit of everything! I did decide on getting a brownie sundae. I was able to choose my ice cream (I chose birthday cake) and my topping (I chose hot fudge). Yo, this did.not.disappoint! My fiancÃ© ordered the Yum Ee Bun with butter pecan ice cream! I tried a bite of that and it was delicious. I think it's one of their signatures menu items. They yum ee bun sort of resembles a donut without the hole. They cut a pocket into it and fill the pocket with ice cream. Amazing! My friend got a milkshake. They will add a yummy rim of the cup for an up charge (worth it in my opinion)! I tried hers too and it was so good! This place gets pretty busy so be prepared to wait in line for a little while... but... it is so worth it! If you have a sweet tooth like I do, stop into Ninety's! You won't regret it!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
My favorite Donut place in Vegas! You gotta get em quick though because the run out so quick in the morning... because they're like crack and so fricken good! They have a variety of flavors and different seasons donuts. Get yourself some addicting DONUTS! The French toast donut is my fav!,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
Ask to sample the soft serve flavors and choose your poison. My group and I came back to this place 2-3 times during our trip to Vegas because it was that amazing. DON'T SLEEP ON THE CRACK PIE. It's one of the best $7 you'll ever spend (second to that $7 ice cream you're about to buy hehehe),unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"I've been here a few times and for some reason always hope it will improve. I love Cake Boss and admire Buddy and his team's attention to detail and love for baking, but this bakery is a huge disappointment. I'm sure the original in Hoboken is incredible but don't waste your time here. The cakes on display aren't impressive and look like anyone made them at home. The cupcakes are extremely dry and none of the pastries look fresh. There are two lines: one to order and one to pay and both are extremely unorganized. I just went yesterday for the first time in two years and realized it hadn't gotten any better. Hopefully they will eventually improve to the standard of what viewers expect when coming to this renowned bakery. Until then, I won't be back.",unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,2
One of the best ice cream I've ever had. We got there around 7:30 and the line was pretty long but we'll worth it. Also the line moves pretty quick. I got the mint and cookies with hot fudge and Oreo pieces. It was so good because they make it homemade so it's not very cold and hard. The staff there was nice too. The prices are cheap for the portions you get.,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
WORLD'S BEST WAFFLE CONES! Definitely try the malt vanilla and chocolate chip ice cream!,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Very friendly staff with lots of patience as we were overwhelmed with the selection of donuts that they had out. All of the donuts range from $2-5 and are definitely worth every penny. We decided to grab 4 big ones and a smaller one and we were already full after eating just one. This place does sell out fast so make sure you get there early! We got there around 9am and were able to get in and get out within 5 minutes. There's also paid parking right outside or if you go around the corner, there are 4 free 15 minute parking spots which is where we parked.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Awesome ice cream with extremely reasonable prices. There are tons of options and the workers are always so friendly and will be accommodating with whatever you order. Cash only, but they do have an ATM. Not very many places to sit there and eat so you have to eat in your car or just wander around the property.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Finally tried it! I didn't expect it to be in a cool, 50's ice cream shop! It was busy, but there were quite a few tables outside and the line was quick. We had the ice cream cookie with banana ice cream and the vanilla ice cream cone- both were so good!",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"We've been to to the Amelie's uptown on College St and on Pineville-Matthews Rd (51) and both are very good. The food is good and the desserts are excellent. Not a fancy restaurant but who cares, the food makes up for that.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
This desert shop came up suggested and I decided to give it a shot and I am SO GLAD I did! The girl working was so friendly and put up with me wanting to try every single flavor. The prices are great. And the Thai tea ice cream is to die for!!! I will be coming back often! I'm excited to try the bubble teas especially. Happy to have a new ice cream shop.,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"If you ever need a reason to visit downtown Las Vegas, look no further. Previously, I tried the lemon pistachio, apple-fritter, and maple donut. I was looking forward to getting the lemon pistachio but was disappointed to learn that they change the menu weekly. Today, I decided to try the Boston creme, creme brulee, Nutella overload, strawberry split, and caramel latte. I also got an old-fashioned donut which is a cake donut with sprinkles. What I love about these donuts is that it doesn't leave an oily taste on your lips afterward. They are so soft and fluffy on the inside and full of flavor. The cream in the Boston cream and creme brulee was not overly sweet and had just the right amount inside. I don't care for cake donuts because they are usually dense and heavy; I just wanted to try this one, and it was no different. The donuts are a little on the pricey side ranging from $1.00 with the most expensive being $5.00. There is construction going on in downtown Las Vegas. If you are coming from Las Vegas Blvd to Carson street, it's closed, so you have to go around the corner and come down on the road. There are about four street parking spaces located directly in front of the store.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"The best pastries in Madison, both in execution and in variety! They make wonderful breads, cakes and so much more. As far as the pastries go my favorite are the vanilla swirl and the chocolate/cheese croissant! Many have tried to imitate these authentic French style pastries and failed. These treats are worth the price you will be very happy! Stop by and gaze into the case you will be tickled by all the choices they offer",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"The infamous Cake Boss bakery! Well I've watched Buddy on the Food Network before but haven't kept up with his show in a while and never knew about a bakery opening here in Las Vegas until a couple of my friends were fond of trying out their bakery. It's located in the Venetian hotel right by his other restaurant. The line wasn't as busy as I would have thought but lines were moving smoothly and quick. There were so many dessert choices that we simply just came here for the popular recommended items which were the cannolis and the lobster tails. We got the original and chocolate canollis. It was different from all the kinds of pastries I've had so it was nice to try something new at a bakery. It was good but not enough to make me crave for more. It had cream wrapped in crispy shells. I preferred the lobster tails over the cannolis though. It's a flaky puffed pastry that was filled with cream. It was rich in flavor but it was delish! Although, the prices of these pastries would make me think twice about splurging on these dessert again. The cannolis were $3.50 a piece and the lobster tails were $5.95 each. These little things added up in total that I spent $50 to share among 8 people. It wasn't that the pastries we had weren't good, it's just that it hasn't lived up to the hype of what people portrayed or expect it to be coming from a big famous name company. It was worth trying though if you haven't had any!",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,3
"Interesting favors, but seems a bit overpriced for the serving size and the employees were all very morose and didn't have any energy at all.",Negative,unknown,Negative,unknown,3
This location is always great. The shop is cute and in a very convenient location. They are well stocked and have a great variety. Their triple chocolate cupcakes are my favorite and always taste great.,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
I had a waffle cone of coffee toffee with a dollop of Lemon Cookie at the bottom. Perfectly refreshing on super hot day.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
Best Donuts in town! This place rocks! Great selection and everything is fresh and on point!,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Great service! Great treats! Big fan of the show and I didn't realize they were in Vegas until we started walking around the hotels. Definitely worth a stop! Try the puff pastry, and the cheesecake so good! I like that you can watch them baking from the windows",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
Mmm...! This place is my favorite for ice cream. I've been to both the Chocolate Shoppe and Paciguio and they don't compare. I got the pumpkin pie and Union topia. Both had rich flavors and textures. The prices are right too. $3.25 for two BIG scoops. Yum.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
Literally Novel ice cream has the best ice cream donuts! I have to beg my bf to take me there 10/10 recommend the Cookie Monster ice cream donut!,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"This is the best ice cream I've ever had, bar none! I had the salted caramel, and it was wonderful! I felt like I was 7 years old and enjoying my first ever ice cream cone. I also love the decor of the shop, the braille on the back wall is so cool (although I do wonder exactly what it says!) I also bought a pint of their ice cream at Whole Foods, I love Sweet Republic and everything it stands for! Totally recommended!",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Best donuts in town! #ToDieFor Been to the one in San Diego, waited like 30 minutes in line, I'm glad we have one in Vegas and don't have to wait that long. It gets pretty busy though, and they close once they sell out. Aside from their sweet donuts, their grilled cheese is very good, its huge too! They have vegan donuts and you can also order online to pick up!",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Churn is an extraordinarily cute Ice Cream parlor located right next to The Windsor. However, for the prices I was under the inclination I was having artisanal ice cream or something. While the ice cream itself was fair and admittedly very very fresh, the prices are a bit extortionist. They do have a lot of options to go with the ice cream, from customized cones to a variety of toppings but I truly do not think the ice cream was as expensive as they made it out to be. Also, for anyone that is curious at all, their rotational menu is all their flavors on rotation, they only really serve about 8-10 flavors at the location. You might want to call and ask what they have before you make the trek there or refer to the online menu, I *believe* it's updated daily. Good ice cream, just pricey.",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,3
"Veryy beautiful interior and a good choice of desserts, absolutely loved the place and the creations",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"Great little ice cream shop. Tried a bunch of flavors before settling on two to share. Fruity pebbles, Cap'n Crunch, blueberry muffin, Cocoa Puffs, and sweet tea were all delicious and tasted exactly like their titles. Definitely worth trying out!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Went there for an inexpensive afternoon snack. Outside seating is nice - although it is right by a bus stop and the main street. Previous reviews indicated that it was a little gem within expensive restaurants. I couldn't disagree more. The ham and cheese baguette I had was probably one of the worst I have ever had. It was old, dry and rubbery/chewy. They did however offer to toast my bitten into sandwich. Bouchon quality for me means freshly made to order sandwiches and not pre-made old ones from the morning. Very disappointed.",unknown,Negative,Negative,Negative,1
"Wasn't like the most incredible customer service, but i'm sure they were exhausted and over working over 4th of July. Nonetheless, graham central station was STUPID good. The flavor was recommended by the associate that was assisting us. We did get charged $.75 on one of our cones for chocolate syrup that probably ended up more so on all the napkins/the floor while the associate was transferring the cone to up. Word to the wise: Even if you order a single scoop, you can 100% share.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"AmÃ©lie's has a great dessert case and an even better atmosphere. Whether early in the morning or late at night, this is the spot.",Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,5
"Best pastries in Madison by far. They run out of items within an hour after opening so you need to hurry. This happens pretty consistently during the weekend so I don't know why they don't just make more. Minus one star for the lack of customer service by the woman who works at the counter/picks up the phone Saturday mornings. She's pretty unfriendly and consistently has attitude when you try to place a hold order. She left me on hold for over 10 mins and clearly forgot about me until I hung up and had to call back, with no remorse. I get that you're busy but no need to throw customer service out the window when your customers aren't there in-person.",unknown,Positive,Negative,unknown,4
"We came here around 12:30pm before closing. I didn't expect to buy leftover donuts but they were a great deal at the moment so we decided to fill the box up with $10. Half of the box were all creme brÃ»lÃ©e, the rest were weird unwanted assorted donuts. The donuts were cold, chewy and unappetizing. Maybe it was because we came late... I wasn't very happy but for the price, it was $1 per donut approximately. None of the donuts were that good, just taste like a regular mom and pop kind of place. I also got a Nitro infused coffee because the guy recommended me as something new to try. Pricey and wasn't worth it. The coffee was SOUR! I'm not sure if it's supposed to taste that way... I mean if you really put your mind to it, you might find it drinkable. I'm a huge coffee lover and it hardly got me to finish half after an hour of walking around downtown. BUT we will be back, earlier for fresher, warm, assorted donuts instead of leftovers! This place got potential and I will update the review with my next visit.",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,3
"When we walked in we were greeted by super friendly and excited staff who told us we could try every flavor if we wanted. All their ice cream is homemade and they get their macaroons special made from a local bakery (deliveries come on Thursdays). We decided on a macaroon cookie bowl, which I HIGHLY recommend getting. The ice cream was probably the best I have ever had; you can definitely tell it is homemade. We decided on their Lucky Charm ice cream was crazy good and got the fruity pebble macaroon, which was gooey and perfect in every way. This would have been enough for me to be thrilled, but then they put it over the top with a toasted marshmallow! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
Super fun place with exotic flavors...they'll let you try as many as you'd like and make great recommendations. Very friendly owner and operator. Will be back!,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"I want to start off by saying I've never actually gone inside the establishment, but I follow them on Instagram and all the fitness models post epic cheat meals with these donuts. So~ when my friend went to Vegas, I made him bring home a dozen for me. Little did I know, a dozen would actually be 2 big boxes! It was totally worth making him lug it around though. Because these donuts were so bomb! We do not have anything like these in Philly. I mean a donut with a poptart in it?! Anyways, after cutting a piece of each flavor to taste them, I ended up freezing them because I couldn't possibly eat them all in one sitting, well I could, but I decided I shouldn't. Well let me tell you, have any of you guys tried frozen donuts before? It was probably even better than when I tried it fresh! How could that be possible?! Well some of the donuts were too sweet when I had it fresh (the poptart one especially) and when it was frozen it was the perfect amount of sweetness. I still dream of eating these donuts. I need to make a trip to Vegas.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Best donut place ever! I went here and got a blueberry cheesecake donut on Friday, and it was heaven! The owner of the Vegas location was so nice, and he was helping his employees serve donuts to the customers which was awesome. The people who I was with got a cake batter donut and a regular cinnamon sugar one, and I tried a few bites of theres, and they were amazing! I live in LA, and I hope they will open one (or many) there ASAP, because it would be wildly successful, and I would eat there a ton. Until then, I will be coming back to this location and all the others and getting new donuts. I heard the poptart donut there is the most popular, and I think they ran out, but I hope to try that next time.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Updating my review from four to five stars because I was back for another visit last night, and I was excited to see interesting, creative, and yummy flavors. I was also impressed with the improved texture of my ice cream this go around. I got the lavender ice cream which absolutely delighted my senses and my hard-to-please elderly friend enjoyed his oatmeal cream pie ice cream ""very much"". I can't wait to go back and try some other flavors (blueberry mint, lucky charms, frenvh toast, etc.), or a cookie ice cream sandwich, affogato, or a waffle cone.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
Ice cream is delicious and the aesthetic of the shop is adorable! Perfect place for dessert after dinner or just a nice spot to hang out and catch up with friends. The only thing is that I wish they had more flavors!,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"It was my first time to Melt. And wow! Most delicious, amazing ice cream...the Cookie Monster, oh my! However, I have to say the customer service killed my overall experience. Music was jamming with a line out the door, but once you got inside you weren't made to feel welcomed. The two working didn't appear to have any excitement serving the anxious and excited customers making the nights most important decision; what flavor?! They had their heads down on their phones for the majority of check out. There was no ""hey guys welcome to melt! Let us know if you have any questions."" Or ""thanks so much for coming in tonight...we'll see you back soon!"" ""Is this your first time in? If so we have punch cards."" The only conversation I had with the girl was ""make sure you bring your flight tray back inside."" My dad has owned a restaurant for 30 years and from my experience I have learned that customer service can make or break your overall experience. Those working for you are supposed to represent your business in the most positive way possible; you kind of expect that being in the downtown Roosevelt district where people represent a chill, cool, and friendly vibe. With all of that said, keep making delicious ice cream at Melt! The flavors are inventive and who doesn't love the take-out containers with the crunch of the fortune cookie to end the party in your mouth. Here's to more happy scooping employees! #lovetheicecreambutnotheonesservingit",Negative,Positive,Negative,Negative,4
"My girlfriend was hungry for dessert after a D'Backs game on Tuesday, but it was almost 10pm. I wasn't optimistic we'd find a dessert spot downtown that late on a week night. But low and behold, Yelp saved the day and helped me find this place just a few blocks from my apartment. They've only been open about 2 months, but per the Yelp reviews already seemed to be garnering a fan base. The place sits in a historic home pretty much in the heart of First Fridays territory. In case you get lost looking for this place, just look for the neon ""Munchies"" sign. When we walked in it was just the owner (who also happens to be the owner of JoBot Coffee). Super nice guy. They don't make their own ice cream, but rather have it made by a local co-op. Their flavors range from Chocolate Raspberry to Chips & Salsa. After sampling seemingly every flavor, I went with a scoop of Cinnamon and a scoop of Vanilla Birthday Cake. When you order a cup as I did, you don't get a cup but rather a Chinese noodle box complete with fortune cookie. Random? Yup. But freaking awesome. She got the Chocolate Superfarm and the Raspberry. There's no seating inside, but there's plenty on the front porch. We were the only ones there (not surprisingly since it was so late on a Tuesday), but thoroughly enjoyed the ice cream and overall experience. Great way to cap off the evening.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Napa's finest in Vegas. This Bouchon location is more of a food stall close to the guest elevators. Next to Grand Lux. They have an actual location in Venetian but I do not think it was open. Busy right when they open. Pastries were fresh. Prices are reasonable for the being in Vegas. Chocolate Croissant - $4 - Flaky and good amount of chocolate inside. Cheese Danish - $4 - Thick and a bit to dense for me. Was not a fan of the cheese. Pistachio Macaron - $4 - Good crust and chewy body. Smaller then the napa one I had. Ton of pistachio flavor. Coffee, large - $4.25 - Basic and overpriced.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4

Thank You Villani's and Welcome to Plaza Midwood. Ron Wright",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Delish! We were looking for a treat after the Dbacks game... Picked the right spot! The girls are sweet and patient with my indecisive husband. I had the Vietnamese Coffee with a peanut butter cookie on the bottom (bomb choice) and he had the mint cookie which he says was ""good"".

"Don't want to go to the restaurant but still want a chocolate croissant? Well here you go. After walking off our brunch, we headed here for a snack to go as we made our way back to LA. I got my requisite croissant, but what caught my eye is their homemade nutter butters. Which are really two large cookies with a creamy peanut butter filling. Basically a large peanut butter cookie sandwich, which tastes just like a Nutter Butter! Bouchon, you've proven your worth. You know your pastries and I will be back to put more of them in my mouth.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"I am so lucky I don't live closer to this bakery or I would weigh 1,000 pounds! 2 visits during a quick weekend trip to Madison was just not enough.

I look forward to visiting again on my next trip to Madison!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Las Vegas Yelpers came to my rescue again with this amazing gem. I ordered the 4-scoop sampler with chocolate chip cookie dough, coconut milk ice cream, peanut butter parfait, and vanilla with oreo. The best part: it only cost $4.25! Not only were the scoops of ice cream decently-sized and filled with mouth-watering, sugar-craving deliciousness but the price was insanely cheap for the amount I received. If I am ever in Las Vegas again I will definitely return for round 2!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Weight watchers beware, this place is simply full of sweets and fattening ice cream sandwiches! You have to admit though that it's a good idea to Treat Yo'self every once in awhile. For those occasions where only delicious desserts will satisfy, I couldn't recommend Ninety's enough! If you're familiar with the boardwalk in the university area then you probably already know where it's at. Park on the side closest to the Light Rail and look for the Chinese restaurant, it's across the walk from there. While there's not much to talk of concerning the decor, it is very clean and there's a bit of seating for people looking to beat the heat. It seems that they're banking on most enjoying their treats on the boardwalk, the rest of the building quickly fills up with excited families and individuals alike wanting a delicious snack. So as far as the treats, what tickles your fancy? They have macaron ice cream sandwiches, ice cream filled doughnuts, ice cream cake pops, all kinds of desserts. You can also get your ice cream in a cup or cone, but why would you? The couple of macaron ice cream sandwiches I've gotten here were outstanding and well thought out. They offer different flavors of macarons paired with specific ice creams and toppings. The team even seems to have a thing for cereals, and incorporates them into a lot of their products! I have to admit, I didn't expect the macarons themselves to be such a high quality product since they're being used in ice cream sandwiches, but I'd say these were excellent macarons. They could even stand on their own with a traditional filling if they chose to do so. Maybe something to consider! I'd love give 'em the perfect score, but last time they were out of a LOT of the specials. They were very accommodating with substitutes, for example they were out of the samoa macaron and just did a regular vanilla on my sandwich. My girlfriend also wanted the coffee ice cream sandwich and they were out of its 'biscotti' macaron so she had to settle for a substitute as well. All in all it they were out of 3 macarons, and 2 ice creams. So I hope that next time I'm able to try some of their named creations as they intended. Still, a very good package either way. Not a gimmick, and still going strong. Way to rock, Ninety's!",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"I usually don't write yelp reviews but WOW Scooptopia's ice cream was absolutely delicious! Locally made ice cream with literally so many flavors they can't all fit the front! My boyfriend got the peanut butter and German chocolate ice cream and I got a waffle bowl with bubble gum, Cookie Monster, and cookies and cream. If you are an ice cream fanatic like me I highly recommend to try some of Scooptopia's ice cream.

"Do yourself a favor, and go to Jeni's!!! I had only been to Jeni's in D.C., and I was so excited to see one when I visited Charlotte. They always have a fun variety of flavors, and they offer a couple dairy free options as well. I'm not usually dairy free, but I ordered the dairy free Texas sheet cake because it looked delicious, and I am so glad I did!! If you like chocolate (with a hint of coconut from the dairy free alternative), you'll love it! I also ordered the salted peanut butter, which was a little sweet for my liking, but still tasty! Highly recommend a visit to Jeni's!!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5

"Stopped by after dinner to grab some drinks and sweets. I had a matcha tea and it was ok. When I get hot tea I want it to be super hot and this was just mildly warm so I had to drink it faster than I cared to. My husband got the Maiko special and it was very interesting. It's a matcha ice cream with all sorts of things, like corn flakes and jelly, added into it. If you are wanting something sweet and sugary this isn't what you want but if you like Japanese flavors or just want to try something different and new you should check it out.",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,3

"Without a doubt my favorite coffee shop in Charlotte, even if they do not have the best coffee. The place is huge with plenty of seating be it tables, sofas or awesome air chairs. They also usually have great music playing which earns extra points in my heart. When I go I always get the french press because I have gone a few times in the past where the drip coffee had been cold, so annoying. The pastry selection is overwhelming in a good way because everything seems to be good, at least from what I have had with the macaroons being my favorite. They also serve real food, the soups are great as are the sandwiches. On the weekends they serve quiche which is among some of the best I have eaten.",Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,5
These donuts are a dream come true! I have been trying to go for a while now and I finally got to taste these delicious creations! They do sell out quickly so be sure to go early in the morning. I got the nutella donut and it was amazing. They have some very creative pastries like the Big Poppa which has an entire pop tart baked inside! The staff is very friendly as well. Great service and great donuts what more could anyone ask for?,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"3.5-4 I come here for ice cream whenever I'm visiting the Union and/or Madison! The ice cream is local and refreshing, especially on a day as hot as a Madison summer. (Beware... my ice cream melted quickly and dropped into a hundred drops when I stepped outside.) It's not a super gourmet place (which I'm snobbily used to), nor is it that creamy (which I prefer), but I am a fan and like coming back this place.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,3
Visited this place with my teenage girls. Absolutely incredible ice cream. A variety of different flavors. It is a walk up window and seating in on adjacent park benches in the walkway area of the strip Mall. The price is decent for what you get.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
Man it took a long while to drive here from the strip but totally worth it. The ice cream options vast and packed with flavor. Beware as the lines here can get long. The service we experienced was kind and patient. They happily offered trials of anything you wanted. I had the special Key Lime Pie and still miss it dearly as I don't live in Las Vegas. This is a small chain and there might be one close to where you live so check out their website. A great experience!,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"I hate to be a Debbie downer, and maybe I picked the wrong flavor, but I was not impressed by my brownie batter ice cream! The signage out front is confusing, it says Ohio City Ice Cream Co. Or something but it's Mason's. My ice cream tasted very fresh but wasn't very flavorful. The staff was very friendly and nice, and it's a teeny tiny little building but it's pretty hip, as you would except for the area. However, I think there are much better local ice cream establishments (Mitchell's for example?). I'm glad I gave it a try!",Positive,Negative,Positive,unknown,3
"Came here on a Saturday afternoon with a couple of friends. There were a few people in line & 2 people behind the counter taking orders & preparing them. I think there were 4-5 people in front of us & it was about a 15 minute wait. I usually get the sprinkles sundae? The cupcake with a scoop of ice cream. The portion is pretty big so I suggest sharing! I got the dark chocolate cupcake with the coffee almond fudge ice cream. I wasn't a big fan of the cupcake... it was too sweet and it was more of a milk chocolate rather than a dark chocolate. The ice cream was pretty good though. They offer a mini size for the sundae, however, they only have limited flavors for the cupcake. I would probably opt for that one if I come back. You can seat your party outside because they have a few tables & chairs. They also have a cute cupcake ATM if you don't wanna wait in line - super handy!",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"I've only been here once but the ice cream was rich and the flavors were creative and expansive. I ordered two flavors: Nutella and strawberry. The strawberry was amazing, sweet and refreshing flavors. The Nutella was a little muted; it tasted vaguely of Nutella. It was much closer to the flavor of a Wendy's chocolate frosty than the rich hazelnut chocolate flavor I wanted. Still, it had great mouthfeel.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"Set Up = 5 Stars Service = 5 Stars Selection = 4 Stars Price = 4 Stars Peanut Butter Chip Cupcake = 5 Stars Carrot Cake Cupcake = 3 Stars I love the set up when you walk in. Ice cream to the right, cupcakes to the left. Heck, even a cupcake ATM outside. Just don't let size of this place and the lines fool you. Yes, Sprinkles is tiny, yes it's crowded, and yes they are quick/efficient. 5 stars for service that's for sure. I didn't try any of their ice creams, but that's happening soon. I tried the Carrot Cake and Peanut Butter Chip cupcakes. For those that know me, know that I love a good carrot cake and anything with peanut butter. So here are my thoughts on both.... Peanut Butter Chip Cupcake: This was so good, moist, had just enough chocolate, and packed with a creamy peanut buttery taste. I've had a few peanut butter cupcakes in my lifetime and would honestly rank Sprinkles near the top. If you're a fan of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, then you'll be a fan of Sprinkles' Peanut Butter Chip Cupcake. My only regret is getting only one. Carrot Cake: The icing was good, but thought that the actual cupcake could have been better. This was packed with a ton of carrots and a little dry. Again, I've had carrot cake cupcakes before and have yet to find one that I really like. Sprinkles didn't impress me with their Carrot Cake. But hey...it's all about their Peanut Butter Chip. If you're at the Linq, then I recommend that you check out Sprinkles and judge them for yourself. I see myself coming back to try one of their ice creams and of course, back for their Peanut Butter Chip cupcakes.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,4

Having said that, they were sweet treats, the staff was nice, and there was a cool ambiance. if I was a college student, I would appreciate this being around (especially given its hours).",Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,4
"Macaroons are good here, but I usually stop by for their delicious ham and cheese sandwich. If you're looking for a quick bite to eat, check out their sandwiches! It's a decent price especially for Vegas food! Also, their macaroons make a good gift, be sure to grab some on your way home for your friends and family!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"I tried this place knowing already how good their desserts are. My wife brought home a cookie and she had been dying to go back. We actually came here Before dinner this time and bought a tin of cookies. 6 for $17. We also got a slice of their crack pie and it was so good. I recommend you try that first. Next time I will try a shake or some of their soft serve concoctions. Will definitely be back. I'd give it a perfect score but it's a bit too pricey, hey, it is the strip. 4.5 stars.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
Looks like a mom & pops shop... Fairly small & not a huge selection but very well stocked. Lots of vintage old school candy. Staff was friendly & helpful I got the FAT ELVIS SUNDAE & man was it delicious! I recommended 110%,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
Sorely disappointed. The hot fudge sundae was lukewarm at best and turned my stomach upside down. We tried to non pareils and the box didn't close and the woman at the front was flippant about it when we asked for a different one which she didn't and just stuck a sticker on it. And the box still didn't work.They haven't had brownies for 2 weeks but no where did they have a sign which indicated that. Only reason I gave 2 stars instead of one is that I like Ghirardelli chocolate but rest of the experience was subpar. I realize places are understaffed and it must be a challenge to find good employees.,unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,2
"I wish I could give this 2.5 stars. We came on three separate occasions, but only actually ordered twice because the line around 7PM on a weekday was absurdly large. Between the huge line and the Yelp reviews, we had incredible expectations. It just wasn't really an impressive dessert, and the huge crowd just isn't worth it.",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,3
"My friend recommended this place and told me their soft serve ice cream are good. So I came with high expectations. We ordered cereal milk with extra corn flakes topping and a crake pie soft serve. The ice cream was very creamy, especially the crake pie flavor. But i think it is lacking some in depth flavor in the ice cream. The first few bit was good but you can get board easily. Maybe I was expecting too much to when we finally got it it was a little disappointing.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,3
"I have had my heart set on Milk Bar since we ran out of time to go on my last NYC visit, it was birthday weekend so my husband wanted to bring me to this location! The service was awesome, the ladies were so sweet & helpful, we ordered a cereal milk affogato, slice of crack pie and candy bar pie, malted cake balls & a cookie for my daughter. Affogato was horrible, as in, inedible horrible. Crack Pie is just like buttermilk pie, the Candy Bar slice was great but just so rich, malted cake balls were meh, couldn't detect the malt flavor. It was all sickeningly sweet and most of it just went in the trash. We were so unbelievably underwhelmed, our total was over $30 & I was really hoping to be wow'd at those prices. We won't be back.",unknown,Negative,Positive,unknown,1
"I tried 6 different pastry items and a coffee drink, and the only good thing was the coffee. For the $30 I spent, it was horrible, the portions were small and it was a complete waste of time. DO NOT go there, just go to Nonas. Much better!",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,1
"Believe it or not, there are some people who live in Vegas that think anything under 80 degrees is freezing. Wink wink! But if there's one thing that's going to get them outside to brave the harshest of frozen desert temperatures in the winter, especially if they're the Yelping type, it's ice cream. I don't know much about the history of Handel's, just mainly that they're from Ohio and people all across the country love them. This new location, while possibly different from others I've heard about, is completely walk up service only. It's located in a shopping center on the NE corner of Tropicana & Hualapai. And even with a space size that puts pretty much every ice cream shop in town to shame, there is absolutely no where safe from the elements that is customer accessible. Well, besides their own vehicles of course. With 5+ walk up windows preparing to operate during all business hours, there shouldn't be any problem getting you served up pretty quickly though. On the menu, you're going to find probably way more options then you'll know what do with. There's hurricanes, sundaes, parfaits, ice cream sandwiches, shakes...the list goes on! And if you just want a good ole fashioned scoop or two, there's about 40 or so different choices between the regular ice cream flavors, sherbets and the monthly special. I'm all for having options, but to be honest, there's almost too much here. It could be just be my indecisiveness kicking in, but it was a bit overwhelming. I will say this though. The 4 scoop sampler is one of the coolest things they offer, and I'd imagine it's got to be pretty popular. It's exactly what I ended up going with, and is a steal at only $4.25. It took a while but we ended up going with Banana Cream Pie, Buckeye, Chocolate Peanut Butter Brownie and Spouse Like A House (vanilla ice cream with peanut butter ripple and chocolate covered peanut butter pretzels swirled in). Each flavor was spot on with what they described and I'd have a hard time picking out a favorite of the four. The banana had a nice, smooth whipped cream type texture and big chunks of banana. The Buckeye had plenty of whole candies in it, which are basically like a big Rolo, but with peanut butter inside. And both the Chocolate Peanut Butter Brownie and Spouse Like A House had plenty of peanut butter flavor without having that terrible frozen peanut butter texture. All were a tad on the sweet side, but very creamy and delicious. The only thing I didn't like is that they all started to melt pretty quick, even in the January winter weather. I imagine during the summer, it'll be tough to finish before you have sugar soup. For being all window ordering, the service is very friendly. Each employee we talked to was very friendly and seemed to be quite knowledgeable about the products. With our visit being on the first day open, I think that's pretty impressive. Adding that to good quality products at great prices, I'll definitely be returning to Handel's!",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
I know this place is called sweet republic but I feel there is just too much sugar in both the ice creams and waffle cones. Flavours are great hence the 4 stars. Kulfi a nice surprise. Will be back at some point but will get it in a cup,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
Brand new uptown location is beautiful! There's much more seating area than the noda location. Desserts don't differ in taste from their noda location.,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,5

"I have long been a fan of the cupcake ATM, but today we went inside. Love the cute decor and all the accessories one can buy in addition to the desserts. So many great choices available at the counter! We bought a 4-pack with the seasonal White Chocolate Raspberry, a Salted Caramel, a Sprinkled, and a sugar-free Red Velvet. I had the sugar-free, and I think the frosting was even better than a regular Red Velvet. My husband proclaimed the Salted Caramel as amazing, my daughter inhaled the regular Sprinkled- and we are saving the seasonal until tomorrow! (If we can.) I feel these are well worth the price ($4). Our cashier was fast and friendly, and encouraged me to join their rewards program, recommending I save my rewards points for ice cream, as it's more expensive! I love the whole concept of a cupcake store, and Sprinkles does it best!",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"I love this place! The cupcakes are moist and fresh; the icing on top is the perfect amount, not too little but not too much. I'm not someone who likes too much cream or icing on the top of my cupcake so the amount that they provide is just perfect. However, the cupcake is a little small for the price ($5/cupcake) but other than that it is phenomenal. They have an ATM cupcake machine outside of the store which is really cute and fun to order through. But even better, inside they have a ton of cupcake and ice cream combinations to choose from as well as toppings. They cut the top of the cupcake off and put ice cream in between the top and bottom of the cupcake. It is a match made in heaven! I highly and strongly recommended it if you are in the Las Vegas area.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,4

"I love this bakery. I fell in love with them when they were in Concord and now I drive all the way into Charlotte to see them. I always go in for a slice of Chocolate cake... (yes, worth the 30 minute drive each way)... and I walk out with 3-4 other things. Often I buy things that are outside of my normal food comfort zone and have loved everything I've tried.

"My wife saw Milk Bar all over social media and had to try. Overall the presentation was nice and it is in Cosmopolitan, so don't expect decent pricing. We ordered the soft serve with and without the corn flake topping, 4 cookies, and the birthday cake balls. We were disappointed, all I can say is that it tastes like super salty dessert. Just overloaded with salt. We weren't expecting great things, but few things are more frustrating than paying a lot of money for bad food. The cookies and cake balls were ok, but again, too much salt and you can get better desserts else where in Las Vegas, like Crumbl or try one of the many bakeries in China Town. I'm giving two stars because the soft serve with the corn flake topping was good, but it was horrible without the topping. We ended up throwing away half of what we ordered, it was not good and waayyyyy too salty. If you like salty desserts, then by all means, but it wasn't for me. There are so many better places in Vegas for desserts, I will never go back to Milk Bar.",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,2

"Loved it! As soon as you walk into the building, you smell the buttery cones. The ice cream is flavorful, creamy, just altogether fatty. I chose the duo and ordered banana cream pie and the dark roast coffee. I think this was a great combo and I enjoyed every last bit of it. The banana cream pie had chunks of banana and pie crust, it was just like eating the pie itself. If I lived in Cleveland, I would only buy Mitchell's, they're THAT GOOD. Mitchell's has some seating available in their brightly lit shop and the line goes fairly quick. I'm pretty sure that everything Mitchell's offers is delicious and rich. My only con is that they don't offer crumbled waffle cone as a topping. How do we try and get a store opened up in NOVA?",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"I was so excited for Milk Bar's arrival. And, I was So disappointed. I got 3 cookies, a shake, and a soft serve ice cream. Everything was OK, but for $26 I expected to be blown away and I wasn't. There are off Strip places for way less money turning out a much better product. I wished that this location was more bakery and less walk up counter. I think when you SEE items in a bakery case... It's part of the experience. Everything here is already packaged to go or, with the frozen treats, you don't see them until you get them. Also, there is no seating anywhere. The Birthday Cake shake was tasty, but fairly small for $10. The soft serve cup is one size, but they do fill it up. I got the cereal milk flavor with the cornflake topping. It definitely tasted like it was supposed to which I enjoyed, bit the ice cream had a weird texture that was off-putting...like the cream was curdled or something. I threw it away about halfway through. Cookies was an OK size and a chewy texture, but 3 for $8?!?!? Completely overpriced. I can cross this place off my bucket list, but I won't likely be back.",Negative,Negative,unknown,unknown,2
"This is hands down my FAVORITE bakery in Madison! You will not be disappointed any anything they make here...my most favorite is their key lime pie , it's so rich and smooth and just a great dessert! I never pass up grabbing a few of their 1"" decorated cookies near the register. It's amazing how something so small can have such a BIG taste! Make SURE to grab a croissant (any kind or flavor they have!!) because they will leave you craving for more - so crisp, soft and delicious at the same time. Also love the fresh soft pretzels and their sourdough. Just a tip if you don't preorder anything - get there earlier than later because things sell out and you will be sad!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5

"We love Hopscotch!! While we have tried many items, our favorites would have to be her chocolate cake (so moist and tasty!) and her marshmallows. Last summer we tried strawberry marshmallows which were divine! We would love to try the infamous salted caramel marshmallows, but haven't had the chance yet. Ordering is very easy online, and Kaya is quick to respond and answer your questions. She is kind and really makes an effort to connect with her customers. Not only are her treats delicious, but also gorgeous! After a recent cake purchase for Mother's Day, my mom referred to her as an ""artist"" and got inspired to create some of her own lampwork beads based off of the color combinations Kaya uses to decorate her cakes. Can't say enough great things about Hopscotch!!",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5

"This is a must for any and all ice cream lovers. After a long day in the sun and wind, myself and 7 colleagues bombarded the poor young staff. First, we were so indecisive, then, we went off with a bang of questions with each order. The young lady at the register was wonderfully polite with a genuine smile the whole time. We each had something different in mind and Jarlings did an excellent job of accommodating all of us. The final order was for a quart of chocolate, which my colleague proceeded to devour and finished within 15 min. Any visit to Champaign will require a visit to Jarlings, now.

"Some things are so good that it's wise you keep it at arms length. I'd have to say that Amelie's falls into that foodie category. Between the pastries, eclectic crowd, creative decor and 24-hour access, I'm pretty sure I'd be a blimp if I lived in N. Davidson! I'm visiting Charlotte this week and hanging with the TonyaP so I knew this place HAD to be good. We popped in last night and there was a line snaking in front of the counter but not to worry, it moves quickly. I stuck my head into the side room and was amazed at what I saw: antiqued furniture, high ceilings and lush fabrics. Everything at Amelie's falls under creative, shabby chic! Loved the overhead light piece shrouded by stainless steel cups, graters and other kitchen items. My eyes immediately got drawn to the lit pastry case where my visual tummy was dazzled by the array of delectable sweets. Pecan pie, fruit tarts, napoleons, eclairs and more, me wants it all! I took it ""easy"" ordering up three items and everything was boxed up for us. But if you know Tonya or myself, we are NOT gonna wait. Plopped ourselves down on some stools and dug in. That pecan pie was wonderful, full of nuts to counteract the rich, sweet filling. And a great sweet crust that wasn't over-baked. One of the best pecan pies I've had since it was more nutty than usual, I tried to hog it all up but shared a bite with my Yelp host. I was buzzing with the sugar so I wisely held off on the peach tart and sea salt brownie until laters... Seriously good baked goods, there's a lot of love and talent being placed into their product here. Update: Finally ate the sea salt caramel brownie and it was UNBELIEVABLE! What can I say but Amelie's rocked it out for me! This bakery would do well in any urban center including San Francisco, call me impressed. So Charlotte, enjoy Amelie's for everything it's got. I for one am totally jealous that you've got this amazingly tempting bakery here. Thankfully I'm 150 miles away, Amelie! We'll have to have a long-distance relationship, girl...",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"If you're drunk, wandering on the strip, these goodies will probably be the most gratifying things ever.. other than Yoshinoya! It's a fun and trendy chain but this popular cupcake spot has only been ""okay"" for me. I've tried several of their flavors but the ones that stuck out was the Triple Cinnamon and the Banana. The taste and sweetness is fantastic. The cake has a consistent moisture and the frosting is thick! However, I was not THAT impressed.. I've had much better cupcakes at small mom&pop bakeries. At about $4 a cupcake, I expected much better. For quick, convenient cupcake service, Sprinkles has an express cupcake ATM(w/service charge) located outside of the shop. It's such a neat idea, it's hard not to try it.. or at least Instagram it. haha What I was looking forward to was their icecream. But yet again, I was heavily disappointed. I ordered the Red Velvet icecream with graham cracker crumbs. I don't know if my sweet tooth malfunctioned that day but the entire dessert was bland. Their red velvet icecream is basically a sweet cream/vanilla with red velvet cupcake chunks in it. I had bites that had big chunks of cake and graham cracker, but still was not getting that sweet satisfaction. I'll definitely come back again to try different flavors and hopefully re-rate this shop higher.",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,3

It was okay, I've had better. It was $10.00. I also bought a mug for $10.00. They put them both in a white plastic bag that said Thank You like you get from Stop and Shop. Very embarrassing having to walk around a beautiful hotel like the Venetian with a Stop and Shop bag.

"With so many 5 star reviews this place caught our attention. On a recent trip to Phoenix one night we decided to have ice cream for dinner. (Try it sometime!) We loaded up and made our way to Novel. It's in a nice, working class neighborhood with well maintained houses just off 7th Ave. it's an area quickly gaining a good reputation for innovative and high quality dining choices. As soon as we walked in we were welcomed by Brandon who told us about their ice cream, the awards they've won and what they are most famous for: stuffed doughnuts. After my family and I tried several samples we each chose a different flavor and a topping for our stuffed doughnut. It's a glazed doughnut without the hole that is used to make a sandwich for their delicious, creamy ice cream. The food alone was worth a 5 star review. But I wish I could give it 6 stars because Brandon and the two helpful and charming young ladies that helped us were warm and friendly and made us feel so welcome. I travel to Phoenix several times a year but sadly this was my first time coming to Novel. Don't repeat my mistake. Of all the places I've been in Phoenix this tops the list of must sees when it comes to dining.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5

"We have been wanting to try Jack Frost Donuts for quite sometime now - so yesterday we made it happen! We had to take a friend back to the airport and thought after all we have read about them that this would be a perfect place to eat away our sadness :-) Jack Frost offers raised and cake donuts. We had to ask the lady at the counter to tell us what our choices were as they are not labeled. She did an OK job but she did not really ""sell"" me on any really. I would have thought me saying it was our first time she might have been more helpful but she wasn't. She did not even point to what was what as she rambled off their names. In the end we purchased a mixed dozen and a half in order to sample a variety of styles and flavors. We had some lemon, some turtle, some salted caramel, some maple bacon, some of their cream sticks and some krullers. I am not usually a fan of a cake donut but theirs are different than most. When I normally eat a cake donut they are very heavy and crumbly but these had a bit moister consistency to them. I tried the Salted Caramel and it was not super sweet - just enough icing to give it a little flavor. I would have like it to taste like caramel but it really did not. It did have a bit of salt flavor though. The Maple Bacon was delicious! The icing is really delicious and the bacon had a great flavor and not just like bacon bits being used. It was the one donut out of all of these I think I would want again. My husband and my sister each had a lemon and they said they were good but nothing as special as we had hoped. I was most disappointed in the cream sticks and Neapolitan we got. The fillings used are very grainy and not flavorful in my opinion. The worst one being the peanut butter. It was overly grainy and way too sweet. We also tried their turtle cake donuts and they were not too bad but the chocolate creme on one of them was lackluster. It was a great idea but there was not much chocolate flavor to it so it fell short of its intended goal. The one without actually tasted better because of this. I really wanted to like this place I had heard so much hype about it, but all in all it was very average. I might try it again just to see if it was an off day...but only if I am on that side of town for something else.",unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,3
Super excited to try this place out! Their ice creams look great! So excited for this location. I'll update my review after they open to the public Update: 7-30-18 I came here over the weekend with my fiancÃ©. We really enjoyed the goat cheese and cherry. Our only issue was the the stools are too short for the outside bar. Makes for a really uncomfortable sitting experience. I can't wait to try some more flavors. It is also in a great location. But don't forget about the old timey Pikes Soda Shop!,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Milk bar is a little expensive for what it is but I expect most places on the strip will charge more. We wanted dessert ASAP and decided to swing by this place. There was a line but it moved quickly even with only one person working. We both decided on shakes, I got the chocolate cake shake and my husband got the birthday cake shake. There's sprinkles all over the top and chunks of cake mixed in with the ice cream. It was really a perfect amount and didn't feel as heavy as your typical ice cream shake. They were so yummy. The straws were nice and fat so you could suck up all those cake chunks. I recommend this place if you want something sweet and cool and you want it fast.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"Gosh, where to even start. This place is just a walk up bar area with the only seating being a small bench. The service was very quick - other than that it was nothing that went above and beyond. But the quality of the dish - amazing! We shared a piece of birthday cake and also the cup of cereal milk soft serve. I am a big sucker for dessert, and if you are too - go here!",Negative,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"I can only write this review for the ice cream side of this place. When we went here there was a crazy line outside the door where a bouncer type worker was only letting a few people in at a time. As you waited (and waited some more) you could peruse the menu. I noticed that most flavors were only available certain days of the week and a handful of flavors were available every single day. I guessed that these were very popular flavors and when I heard they would let you try two flavors I decided to test my theory out. I tried Rocky Road which is my go to flavor but when I tried SALTED CARMEL something magical happened in my mouth and brain. When I think about it now, the name SALTED CARMEL requires me to type in all caps, but what I really want to type is SALTED MUTHA EFFIN CARMEL. Holy Samoan on a tightrope batman! This flavor is the bizness. So much so that I went back less than 48 hours later to bring a friend to try it and have another magical dopamine firework show go off in my brain. The second time I felt like a big piggy for being there again so soon so I asked for a kids cup size and they really tried to convince me that it would be too small. I stuck to my guns and was glad I did because it was the perfect size. Thankfully this place is on the strip and not right near my house. If you're at the Linq you should try this place and the SALTED MUTHA EFFIN CARMEL ice cream. You'll be thanking me and hating me at the same time.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
freaking love this place!!!! All their breads are so delicious and fresh. My favorites are the garlic cheese bread and the mango custard bread. Their drinks are delish too! I would recommend the peach green tea or jasmine green tea or salted caramel coffee. All my favorites! I haven't had any of their desserts but I'm sure they are just as good. The employees are always so sweet too!,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Great cookies, great canoli, great coffee.Large selection of beautiful desserts and lunch itmes. Looking forward to going back!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
Pretty cool place. They give you samples to make sure you like it before you order. It's all based on the flavor of milk after cereal. Novel concept and it's executed well.,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,5
"Five words to insure happiness...Iced Mocha with Cereal Milk! I also tried the Compost Cookie, which was very good. My only disappointment was when I tried to get one more Caffeine fix before leaving Vegas and they weren't open at 7:30 am. Milk Bar...if you are going to serve such great coffee, you need to be open earlier! It's an order at the counter kind of place, which can sometimes feel a little rushed, but the staff is very friendly and accommodating. We will definitely be back. Best Coffee this Vegas trip.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
Villani's has the absolute best cheesecake! Would highly recommend you get the plain!!,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Sweet Treats It has been a very long time since I revisited Mary Coyle's and a few things have changed. Lunch items are no longer offered on the menu, this place had the best BLT sandwich that was loaded with bacon. Even though the lunch items are gone Mary Coyle's is serving up some of the most delicious sweet treats, some of the best ice cream in town. On this visit my lunch companion and I shared the Caramel Cashew ""God Bless You"" and the ""Thick Ol' Fashion Chocolate Milkshake"" and both were delicious. The ""God Bless You"" was the perfect mix of Vanilla & salted caramel cashew ice cream, caramel topping, topped with cashews, whip cream and a cherry on top. The ice cream was smooth, rich and full of flavor as was the chocolate shake. If you're ever craving delicious homemade ice cream, great customer service, and wallet friendly prices, stop in you won't be disappointed.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
It is a good thing Handel's Homemade Ice Cream is on the other side of town! YUM. Super friendly staff and it is delicious. No place to sit down- just counter to order from. So many different flavors to choose from. Since it was the first time they suggested vanilla- which Was creamy and burst with vanilla goodness. On Tuesdays they have $2.50 special... that could be dangerous for my waistline! But every once in a while wonderful treat!!,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
Awesome atmosphere! A lot of pastries to choose from. Could use some more sandwich/ other options. I had a turkey and Brie sandwich which was delicious! But there were not may other non sweet treats to choose from. A great date spot or meet up w a friend,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,4
"All the hype not the best donuts I've ever had.. looks aesthetically beautiful, but lacks flavor and all the donuts were pretty much just all dough. We bought 8 donuts and most of it went in the trash. I live in Summerlin paid $20 for Parking and spent $35 for donuts. Wanted to see for myself what all the hype was about. The donuts are just BIG Oversized donuts that look pretty, some average as far as taste and some were really dry.",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,3
"I am not much of a fan for glorified ice cream, but this place is pretty decent. Their cookies are pretty good. They have a lot of flavors and cater to different tastes. My favorites are the chocolate ones. I think they have one called triple chocolate, and for chocolate lovers out there, this is definitely one to try. The ice cream is really good too. I tried the milk cream with cornflake crunch and I was blown away. Before trying the ice cream, I thought it was just vanilla covered in the Corn Flakes cereal. I was sure wrong. The ice cream was very delicious and not too creamy. The flakes are what make the ice cream, and they give you a healthy amount. Each bite you take is filled with bunches of flakes and they even give you a good serving on the bottom of the cup, so you aren't stuck with just the toppings on top. The flakes are very savory and each bite is filled with bits of joy. I would definitely come back here again for a nice cup of ice cream.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
They have very unique flavors and their ice cream is delicious! The owner was very nice and engaging. We don't live far so we will be back soon!,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Local slow churned ice cream with the perfect amount of butter fat. Mix it with your favorite childhood cereal and this brings you back to childhood memories. This is a must try in Phoenix and perfect for any hot day to cool down. Once you try this, you'll want more.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Honey Bleu Cheese ice cream. I loved it! But then again one of my favorite snacks is good bleu cheese drizzled with honey on crusty bread. The ice cream did not disappoint. I bought a pint to go and a pint of the salted caramel, which was good, not great. Not nearly as good as the Honey Bleu Cheese. The ice cream is high quality, and it should be for $7.50 a pint! That's the only reason I don't give them 5 stars. It is pricey for what is - ice cream. I'll be back for a special treat, but it's not something I can afford on a regular basis.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
Strawberry ice cream in a pretzel cone!!! Da bomb!!! Only giving 4 stars because I am lactose intolerant and suffered greatly after eating it... But it was worth it!!,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,4
"my friend judy and i had dessert here after our pizza dinner. i've never had craft ice cream before so i was excited to try something new. i had the maple bacon and joba coffee combination mini scoop. good call. judy had the joba coffee and chocolate. love the way the scoops are put in small chinese take out containers and topped w/a fortune cookie, how adorable.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"Campbell's Popcorn Shop is the latest food destination I'm recommending to people. Usually it goes ""OMG. I wish I had some Dichotomy Mix right now!"" It doesn't matter the time of day, or if I'm hungry. I just love the cheddar/caramel corn mix. People usually say ""Wutch you talkin' bout, Willis?"" and then I tell them all about Campbell's. I like that I can try any flavors from a neat little vending sample machine from the counter. There are also chocolate creations like turtles and peanut butter cups. You may purchase your popcorn by regular or large bags, or tins! I made a special trip on Saturday to Ohio City just to stop and get a couple of bags of the Dichotomy for double booked Saturday parties. I love it when you introduce people to a superior food product and you can literally see the moment while they're taking their first bites and they realize it is superior. I had several of those moments on Saturday night. So far, no matter how good the other flavors are, and they are all good, I have only bought dichotomy. When you've found the best, can you really deviate? Don't Deviate from Dichotomy is my slogan for 2012. Dig it?",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"So good. Like really, really tasty. Probably best if you skip the not so awesome dinner wherever you are in Scottsdale and just go here for the delicious ice cream. Don't miss salted caramel. Enjoy!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"My husband, friends, and I were super excited when visiting Vegas and stumbled up the escalator at The Cosmopolitan to the Milk Bar. I am a HUGE Tosi fan and was expecting to be wowed! My husband and I ordered a full Birthday Cake to-go. We waited ~30 minutes for the cake. They boxed it up for us as we wanted to enjoy the cake back in our hotel room. I was so disappointed once we dug in. The cake tasted sour (mainly the frosting). It really had this spoiled sour taste. This has left me questioning their quality control. Did they make the frosting with spoiled milk? We don't live in Vegas so maybe I'll have to give the LA store a try someday. Or maybe we'll get one in San Francisco someday.",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,1
Yeah... THE BEST!!! Busy but went fast! Dude that waited on me was patient cause I kept piling on afterthoughts...so now I sit with my Pelligrino and enjoy hanging out in Little Italy!!! I reallly like Presti's.... Aaaaaand... Bruchetta YUM! Stuffed meat stromboli? Aaah! Delsih! I still have a sausage pizza in the fridge!!! Yup...That rocks!!!,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Super soft and melt in your mouth cupcakes . I tried various flavors with my friends and we all loved it. The red velvet cupcake was delicious, the cream cheese frosting wasn't too over sweet. Great combination and balance of flavors. The cupcakes came in the cutest box and were very fresh. Very good and professional service also, I signed that day for a reward card and save $5 on my order!",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Crack pie $7 Worth every bite . Caramel sweet thinly sliced pie. Texture, somewhat chewy and soft. Delicious pie crust. A tad bit of powder sugar. Very good and delectable after a meal. Would buy again. Small but good.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Poor customer service, the cashier as well as the employee who bagged our pastries both had attitude and were not friendly. The setup is not organized, a lot of customers do not know they have to wait in a second line until they hear their named called after they select their pastries because the employees fail to tell them beforehand. Not a great experience but the cannolis were amazing nonetheless.",unknown,Positive,Negative,unknown,3
This is a great ice-cream shop right across from our favorite taco place. The chocolate and coconut on a pretzel cone are out of this world. Highly recommended. There is a reason why there is always a line here.,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,4
"No more classic red velvet cupcake. The bakery has updated the classic cupcake to a filled red velvet cupcake. And now there is too much cream. I dissected the cupcake and it was stuffed with so much cream. The cupcake cake was 65% cream and 35% cake. I miss the classic red velvet cupcake. I hope next time I get back to Bouchon Las Vegas, they have their classic red velvet cupcake.",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,3
"I've been here twice and both times have been bad experiences. The first time I came, the pastry I got was old and hard. The second time I got a couple of pastries and shared them with a few other people and we all got food poisioning. I don't know if the bakers aren't being very clean when baking (i.e. not washing hands, or sneezing/coughing on baked goods) or if certain ingredients aren't being stored properly but something needs to be fixed.",unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,1
Wonderful ice cream and the seasonal flavors make the experience even better! They get slow on tuesdays ($2 Tuesdays) but still worth the wait. The Peppermint stick and blueberry cobbler are my favorite.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Had a coffee macaroon and a chocolate eclair. They were alright. Nothing to write home about. The macaroons are larger than your usual size, but since it didn't taste particularly good, $3.50 is still a rip off.",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,3
"I love Dripps, they have great customer service. The staff is friendly and helpful. The ice cream is amazing, the cereal is not soggy at all.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
It was the best ice-cream. My daughter loved it as well. We will be back soon. Don't forget to order macha coco together with your ice-cream. It was perfect match.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"I'd give 3 stars for the ice creams and 4 stars for the waffle cone. The service only deserves 2 stars. I came in on a nice and sunny Sunday afternoon and I had to wait about 15 minutes to order and the line wasn't even that long. There were only 3 people working. One person is the cashier, one is the waffle cones maker and only one person waiting on the customers. You can imagine how slow the line moved with some of the customers wanted to sample the ice cream and only one person serving! I ordered the coffee and cream, salted peanut butter with chocolate speckled and Lavender. The Lavender is the only flavor that deserves recognition. I think Jeni's ice cream are just like any other ice creams. Their texture and flavors are ordinary.",unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,3
"Hustle and bustle at this NY chain in Vegas. These people were workin hard on a busy day. They were quick, kind and acknowledged everyone in line. Great work! Soft serve cereal milk and those birthday cake truffles. Not too bad. The crack pie wasn't bad either just a bit too sweet. The desserts were all pretty sweet, actually, for me but that's me and my opinion doesn't change that this place is good on what they do. So, don't knock it 'til you try it. :D",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,3
"Busy Saturday Night when we came in, about 10:30 PM. Line was out the door. An employee was handing out free samples of the caramel chocolates for the waiting patrons. Great Customer Service! Shop offers their paper menus on a stand as you walk in the door. Great way to review their options before ordering. We had a scoop of the Cookie Dough Ice Cream, & a Hot Chocolate. Both were tasty. The Sundae looked really amazing.. Nice atmosphere located in a The Linq. Lots of other great shops throughout the streets that will be sure to light up your curiosities too!",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"The donuts looks way more appealing than the actual taste. A co-worker brought a bunch into the office. There were literally so much to choose from. Green tea, crÃ¨me brulee, strawberry shortcake, pop tarts in different flavors, blueberry cheesecake, maple bacon, pumpkin spice, cookies n cream, birthday cake oreo and a few others. Some tasted better than others. Donuts tasted fresh and the cake wasn't dried. I had half of the green tea one. No green tea taste to it at all. In fact, it tasted more like a lemon flavored donut with green colored frosting on top. The strawberry shortcake and blueberry cheesecake however, was FABULOUS!!!!!! It really taste like it sounds. I can imagine if you have a major sweet tooth, this place would be heavenly for you. I'm glad I was finally able to try their donuts though. But personally, I'm more of a cupcake kinda gal. Remember...choose your donuts wisely.",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,3
Pastries are delicious but the place is pretty dirty I'm afraid to touch anything. I like the one in SC more. It's exponentially cleaner. Nonetheless by far the best pastries in town!!,Negative,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"Stopped by on recommendation from a local police officer. She was spot on. Great bakery. Muffins were cake like and addictive. Cookies were great. Cannoli was great, yet I have to say I do not eat it often. Staff was very helpful and friendly. I did give 5 stars yet I did not eat any other food. It looked great. A must stop for Little Italy.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5

"It's hard to find real ice cream in the valley. There are hundreds, if not thousands of frozen yogurt spots, but real ice cream really is rare. After reading some interesting articles on Sweet Republic, we finally decided to drive on down to Scottsdale and check it out. It''s in a strip mall (of course), and the interior is pretty cute. Modern and clean. Plenty of tables to enjoy your ice cream, and a few scattered outside. Their ice creams are made in house, in small batches, with local, all natural ingredients. I had the az mint..you can actually see the mint leaves. It was different, but good.",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
Amelie's is delicious and a great place for our small book group to meet. They make a great French press & everything I've had to eat there is out of this WORLD!,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Delicious ice cream - environment is friendly....little loud but not too bad. I had an ice cream cake there and it was tremendous! You can check out the area that they actually make the ice cream which is nice as well. Has a nice feel and temperature inside... And the entire building looks nice and clean. If I am ever in the area again, I'd love to stop by this place for a nice treat, again!",Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,5

"AMAZING doughnuts for vegans and non-vegans alike!! I'm usually out of town on the weekends so my mom waited in line for about 30 minutes yesterday morning to get us some doughnuts. It was well worth it. We got the key lime pie, glazed twist, blueberry cake, strawberry shortcake and raspberry lemonade. The blueberry cake was my personal favorite but I'm also partial to cake doughnuts but it was delicious and not super oily or overly sugary. The perfect cake doughnut. My mom and aunt loved the key lime and strawberry shortcake, some of the best doughnuts they've ever had they said. Love that their menu changes a little every month so I already know I'll be back to try out whatever new flavors they whip up.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"This place is SO fun and amazing! Came here after looking up dessert places in the area, and I bookmarked this place because it sounded super unique. Also, we all know that the best part of cereal is the milk at the end, right? When you walk into the shop, you are greeted by the fun cereal boxes along the wall/shelves and the neon lights. The menu has a lot of unique offerings in addition to the ability to create your own mix. You can also opt for a milkshake or cereal in a bowl. I always opted for the milkshake, and I personally think that is the way to go. I was able to try the cosmo and Wanda, Scooby snacks, and mucha lucha. My favorite was Cosmo and Wanda because I love fruit loops and captain crunch berries. This place makes you feel young and alive. It brings back good memories of childhood. I am so happy this place exists and is able to bring joy into the community!",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"The doughnuts are ok but not for the price 15.75 for 6 small doughnuts, Lol... thinking back a bit I remember getting a dozen for 2.50, I know times have changed but wow 15.75 for half dozen not worth it.",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,3

"Novel is a ""must go"" if you are craving ice cream! The flavors are super unique which makes it even more awesome. Yesterday we had cake batter and an apple cider ice cream, so bomb! I also love the unique toppings that are available (shown in the 2nd picture). Check Novel out. The owner is also always there and very nice and tells you the story behind the flavors which is personal and awesome!",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5

"It's not healthy, and they aren't trying to hide it. The ice cream is actually quite superb. Loses 1 star for the usually dismal service, amount of eye rolling and just general lack of caring by staff. I'm not sure if this a managerial problem, but many times the place will be PACKED and you will have one person tending to customers, and the other one will be making ice cream sandwiches or something equivalently unnecessary (when you can see a refrigerator full of sandwiches that are not being eaten). You can ask to try the ice creams, but don't expect them to be happy about it. I've taken to not getting ice cream anymore and ordering the chocolate covered frozen banana. It's still really tasty and I assume a little bit healthier?",unknown,Positive,Negative,unknown,4

"One of my favorite dessert places! The ice cream is not too sweet, it's just right. The ice cream with the fruity pebbles cereal tasted exactly like a bowl of cereal but in a ice cream form.

Worth every penny. Cake was so fresh.frosting not too sweet. The milk chocolate tasted so real. I wish I had bought a t-shirt.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
Went to check out this place over the weekend and I had the Maiko Speical! The ice cream (Macha & Vanilla) and the sponge cake was good but the mochi and the agar jello are very bland. The mochi was very doughy and the agar jello has no flavor. Overall this place is a cool place to hang out with friends.,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,4
"I LOVE LOVE LOVE Amelie's. I have taken out of town guests here many times and they have really enjoyed it too. It's convenient that it's open 24 hours, BUT it does get very busy at times where you have to wait in line. The prices are not cheap but you are paying for quality and delicious, authentic French sweets. My one complaint is that on more than one occasion we could not easily find somewhere to sit because it was so busy. Try the salted caramel brownie!",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5

It was decently busy when we arrived, the staff was great at moving people through the line!",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"The flavors are unique and tasty. They carry vegan flavors if that's your thing. Guava is the best I have had this far. Vegan Oreo was alright for being non dairy. I loved oreo matcha.

Good coffee and pasties. Excellent helpful service. A nice way to start the day. Croissants and cookies both excellent.,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
I came across this after eating some poke at the same plaza. The brightness and the decor caught my eye. After looking at their simple menu I understood their concept. I chose fruity pebbles for the milkshake mix in and that nostalgia hit me. Oh those kids memories! The milkshake was flavorful and soft. I had a sample of their matcha late and it was on point: not too sweet and strong matcha taste. The thing that bothered me was that the place was packed and I had to share the table with another party.,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,5
"Wow! Talk about heavenly baked goodness! I love tje smell of baked goods... i couldn't resist! The smell just draws you in... From outside the shop you can smell the yumminess but when you walk in you just get overwhelmed by not only the smell but the shop is full of all the bake goods... I wanted ot all... We walked around at least twice before started to pick out our goodies to take home... The shop itself was very retro and clean... the set up was very easy to follow and well set up... all the staff was busy hustling around stocking, cleaning, or helping customers... For a weekday in the middle of the day was pretty busy but the shelves were constantly being refilled... i had the bacon buns which was really good the bread was so soft and the bacon made it so much more tasty... i also had the strawberry shortcake it was so light and dreamy with the fresh strawberries... yummy!

"My husband and I love cake boss so when we saw this place we just HAD to try it. We were not disappointed, the pastries we got were absolutely delicious and delectable. They were sweet and soft, not over baked. And the staff was great, they helped us decide since we didnt know what to choose they have soooo many things!",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Very cute shop, extremely instagram friendly with the green plant wall and neon sign. Super cute decor and couches, everything was spotless! The menu was a little confusing. I decided to do the standard combination because I didn't know what to choose based on my own combo. They have a lot of cereal topping options and the consistency is great! It is much better than cold stone creamery. It's around $7 for a cone or milkshake. They also have boba and fresh matcha tea. I'll have to try that next time. The strawberry shortcake was definitely my favorite, they placed fresh slices of strawberry on the side with sprinkled cinnamon crunch on top. It was a good size, almost too big to finish. The cone tasted very good. Definitely worth checking out if you're interested in mix-in style ic cream",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"I heard about this place in an article for the top 10 ice-cream places to cool down in the U.S. and was surprised I hadn't heard of it before. I biked down there on Monday night because they're open late and saw the shoppe in an old house in the Roosevelt district. There were two cute cats by the front door to greet us as we walked in. I had the Superfarm and my co-conspirator had the coffee. Both were delicious, served in a chinese-take out container and with a fortune cookie! Can't wait to go back.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
This place is ok but don't go early - staff is slow and most items don't get put out until after 9 or later. Definitely overpriced and everything looks better than it tastes. Lots of better options nearby.,unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,1
"my favorite part of the store is the whole kitschy vibe goin' on. tons of retro candies, cute cake platters piled high w/ obviously homemade baked goods, shiny espresso machine, cute menu, homemade ice cream.... the banana and blackberry flavors were really good. the husband and i shared a sandwich of banana ice cream between a white-choc-cashew? and a kitchen sink cookie.i dunno if i'd go so far to say that they (the ice creams) were a-ma-zing. but they were pretty darn good. (you have to understand that i'm judging based on all of my ice cream experiences... comparing w/ Bi-Rite Creamery, Humphrey Slocombe, Scoops, and myriad other ""gourmet"" ice cream shops). as far as my AZ ice creamery experiences goes... this is pretty up there. i think what stands out about churn is that it is clearly HOMEMADE. and i mean that in a good way. you can tell that they haven't industrialized or lost any of the ""made with love"" touch. which is nice! and different! the main drawback of such a small business is there can be a bit of a wait if you come in with/after a large group. and by large i mean 4 orders of ice cream. we were that large group. oops. summary: Churn is the PERFECT ending to a great dinner at Windsor. support local small businesses!!!",Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,3

"I was really looking forward to trying Milk Bar, but to my dismay, it really wasn't that great. It's not even that the prices are ridiculous or anything; the sweets just didn't live up to the hype. When we went around 1:30pm on a Sunday, there was about 10 people in line and it didn't take too long to get to the counter. They ran out of a few of the popular cookies so we ended up getting the crack pie, corn cookie, blueberry and cream cookie, birthday cake truffles, and the cereal milk soft serve with cornflake crunch. The crack pie was way too sweet for my taste, though I enjoyed the consistency of the pie.. The blueberry and cream cookie was kind of oily, and the corn cookie was pretty good. I only had a bite of the soft serve because I was so full, but my first impression was slight disappointment and that I've had better. So all in all, I may have expected too much, but it was simply a mediocre experience.",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,3
"Honey Hut Ice Cream is the BEST local ice cream in Cleveland, period. My faves... Chocolate Peanut Butter, Honey Pecan, German Chocolate and Birthday Cake! My guys like the cookies and cream and Vanilla Chocolate Chip. You have to try Honey Hut....you'll never want that ""other"" local ice cream place again! Worst thing about Honey Hut...I live in Old Brooklyn and there's a store there as well...which means we have to limit ourselves to every other week :)",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Awful... If I want to start a horrible restaurant I'm going to slap a French Bistro name on it so it sounds fancy. They did a great job with social distance including the staff who distanced themselves in the back not to be seen. Up front service was painfully slow. My wife ordered a croissant and a overpriced $4.50 lemonade. Simple enough. I ordered an $8 chicken sandwich on a baguette. Sounded great. Didn't come with anything. The guy at the counter asked us to step aside and wait for my sandwich which he said would take 5-10 minutes. I thought I heard him incorrectly. Just do the math in your head to build a sandwich with 4 ingredients. The restaurant was dead. 15 minutes later my fancy French sandwich came out. It was tiny and the chicken was thin grilled pieces. Some blue cheese crumples and bonjour! The experience was horrible with a fancy accent over the ""e"".",unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,1
These are real gourmet donuts with a nice price their coffee is also good and the staff is so friendly you can tell they put a lot of time and effort into not only their donuts but to their coffee also I like the maple bacon donut and I got a latte which was awesome!,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Jeni's is ALWAYS on point. Midwest grown and slowly making its way from coast to coast! I first heard about Jeni's several years ago when I met a girl from Ohio when I lived in San Francisco. We became friends and both being from the Midwest we shared some of the things we loved and missed... one of those things for her was Jeni's ice cream! So you can only imagine how excited I was when I was living in St. Louis a few short years later and they opened a location. It was as good as my friend hyped it up to be!! Sadly (well not now, but at the time) I moved to Charlotte and there was no Jeni's. SIGH. Fast forward a year and a half later and BOOM! Jeni's has arrived! I couldn't wait to get in line and once again see if it lived up to the hype... which it did! The flavors are so unique and delicious!! Since it's summer they ended up having a few seasonal flavors, one of those being frose!! It was a delicious sorbet type treat and the one I ended up going with! That is after I tried half the flavors! Again, this isn't your normal ice cream shop and you should enter with an open mind and empty stomach! They'll let you try as many flavors as you want, don't be greedy though, if you find what you're looking for (or if your stomach is telling you yes) GO FOR IT!! They do half scoops which are comparable to a small/kiddie scoop at a regular ice cream shop. $4 for a scoop or three for $6... no brainer, go for THREE! And don't forget fresh, homemade waffle cones or waffle pieces come with every scoop!! If you're looking for that cool delicious treat for your summer evening, hop on over to Jeni's! Or anytime for that matter!",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
Finally!! A great place for ice cream and halo halo in downtown Phoenix!! Super friendly staff and the halo halo was fantastic!! Found my place for great desserts and the variety of ice cream is GREAT!!,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"The staff is super friendly. The only reason why I gave a 3 stars is the price. I ordered a kiddy size $3.95, Half a macaron $1.50 (it looks full sized but it only has one cracker part), and a marshmallow $1. Thanks goodness it has a $10 yelp discount. The ice cream tastes good. The coconut mango is kind of too sour for my mom. I liked my coffee ice cream.",unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,3
"Wow! Novel Ice Cream sure is a novelty. Their flavors are new, original, and magically unusual. Between the unexpected mix of a hot donut and ice cream to the flavor profiles ranging from an amaretto with animal cookies in a cone to a perfectly not too sweet honey lavender scoop it's pretty amazing. Love that their menu rotates and the possibility of trying even more flavors on my next visit.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
Very friendly staff! The ice cream is very unique. Go here if you are in the mood for something new and unusual! Their fruity pebbles ice cream tastes just like the cereal! I only wish they had a few more elements from your everyday ice cream store- like chocolate ice cream. Overall good experience though.,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"This place is really good! It took me awhile to find but i did find the place. The parking lot is much to be desiered. The place is small but decent. They were extremely friendly and helpfull in letting me make a choice on what i wanted. I ended up getting cookies and cream, with a red velvet macaron and a toasted marshmellow. Yum! Ive never had a macaron before so this was my first time and i loved it! The toasted marshmellow was to die for.. the outter shell it made and breaking it open to find the gooey fluff just ooze out. Ugh, perfection! I could have had 4 of those on my ice cream and i would have been good to go. I will say they are a bit expensive. Mine came out to $8 which, the ice cream was good, but i dont think its good enough for $8.. Its worth a shot and make sure you use your check in offer!",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,3
"I love Handel's! The ice cream here is absolutely fantastic. They have a huge variety of flavors and a really good special on Tuesday's. I'd give it 5 stars if there was a place to eat your ice cream that wasn't only outside. It's nice sometimes, but most of the time I don't enjoy eating my ice cream in 110 degree weather. It's always a race to eat my ice cream before it melts and sometimes I wish I could just sit back and enjoy it, because the flavors really are delicious.",Negative,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"Ninety's has SO much hype around it and it's been on my list all summer to try it out. Its University location isn't the most convenient, but I finally made it up there. I'm glad I tried it, but I can't say I walked away thrilled. To be fair, I am not very interested in their specialty treats - the macaron ice cream sandwiches or cookie dough pops.I just tried a good old-fashioned waffle cone with two flavors - moose tracks and some peanut butter pretzel something (the scooper mumbled the flavor name and I heard peanut butter so I went for it). Both flavors were solid - the moose tracks had an insane amount of fudge in it (delicious but honestly a little too much for me) and the peanut butter element of the other flavor was just enough. My friend got the brownie milkshake which was definitely underwhelming. If I go back, I'll try a more exciting milkshake with the edible rim. Otherwise, Two Scoops still wins best ice cream in Charlotte. I gave them four stars for their unique offerings in which I happen to have limited interest. There's gotta be hype for a reason, right?! Note on the location: the shop is located in a large shopping center and parking is somewhat of a nightmare. We went at 8pm on a Friday and it took five minutes to find parking. There was no line when we walked in but there was a long line when we left. Expect this place to be ALWAYS busy. However, they move quickly and have a lot of people working behind the counter, so the wait should never be unbearable.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
Kinda pricey and my one order took 15 minutes. Think I'll just go to Culver's next time,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,3
"Really good food all around. The pastries are to die for, but they also have really good breakfast sandwiches. I love the eclairs and the tarts. The prices are really reasonable and the service is very friendly. My advice is to get there early in the morning when the bread has been freshly baked.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"Not worth it! My husband and I stopped by and got a vanilla cupcake with buttercream icing and a slice of chocolate cake. Cupcake: I would much rather have a Walmart cupcake. The icing had no flavor and the cupcake had to of been a day or two old, it was soo dry. Chocolate cake: it was moist but lacked something. The service was good, everyone was friendly and helpful. Needless to say I was so disappointed, I had high hopes for this place!",unknown,Negative,Positive,unknown,2
"came here on a Tuesday afternoon, there was no line thank God! they have nice flavors, it smells really good in the surrounding area, like fresh waffle cones and sugar. cute photo oops near by. they have a lot of unique flavors, I got the butter cake I believe. they're a little pricey and lines can get crazy long.",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"Birthday truffles. BOMB. Compost cookie. Eh. Their version of a White Russian. WOO. This is like a big kids dream come true. I'm dying to go to the New York location but this will do for now. Located upstairs you'll find it next to Momofuku restaurant and I believe some kind of a juice bar. I panicked and ordered the basic things: Birthday truffles and compost cookie. I also ordered their version of a White Russian. The birthday truffles are BOMB DIGGITTTTYY. So soft and melt in your mouth. Be careful if you don't plan on eating them immediately. Because they are so soft, they can get squished!!! A big fat duh but still. Some people's children y'know?? The compost cookie though... I heard it was good but I am not the biggest fan. It's good but not omg amazing. Their version of a White Russian? Like I said before. WOOOO. Make sure you mix that baby up good before, during, and after you drink it because that alcohol SITS. And boy is it strong. I loved it but it gave me a headache. I cannot wait to go back and try more of their goodies!!",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,4
"Adorable place, with fantastic donuts. The creative donuts here are the reasons why I wanted to give this place a try. It's like a new wave going on with donut chains popping up in cities. I feel a little bad for the mom and pop shops, they're going to have to step up their game. It's one thing to have cute and creative donuts but the most important part is that it has to taste good as well. I wanted to try the pretzel shape donut, but I didn't see it when I got there, so the the worker told me about a french toast donut that was made fresh. It took about several minutes to make, and it tasted just like what it was called a, ""French Toast Donut"". It was literally a french toast donut. I also ordered the bitrhday donut with oreo inside and a glazed buttermilk for my boyfriend. All the donuts we ordered exceeded or expectations. I can't wait to come back next time, and hopefully get my hands on the pretzel donut. *When you're there don't forget to check out their incredible aquarium created by the guys from TANKED.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5

"It was ok. The crime brÃ»lÃ©e was the best one out of the donuts I got. The poptart was a bit much and needed to be heated up to really taste good. Overall nice selection, but was hyped up a little too much.",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,4
"Bakery heaven. After hearing so many raving reviews about this place I decided on a Sunday afternoon that I had to make the trek to Willy St. to try it out. And whoa, yeah it's that good. I only tried the Ham and Gruyere Croissant and the Cranberry Walnut Scone with Orange Glaze but holy crap. There was so much filling in that croissant! Probably the biggest and most tasty one I've ever had. The ham was so yummy (saw it was from Jordandal - yay!). The perfect amount of ham and cheese made for a delicious snack. I ate the scone the next morning for breakfast and it was still moist and delicious. I may just have to make this a new weekend routine.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
I tried the peanut butter cupcake & was not impressed. It was slightly cold like it was frozen & almost thawed out. It was dry but the frosting was good. My husband loved the black & white cookie. He said it was the best he's ever had.,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,3
"These really are some fantastic donuts! Do expect a line and do expect the flavors to sell out quickly. They have such a great variety, were they not so pricey I would be tempted to get one of each. Be sure to use the Yelp check in for a free coffee with the purchase of a dozen. The donuts are very rich and super sweet, one was more than enough for me, I suggest going with a group and splitting a bunch of them. Also ideal for parties and events as they are beautiful and sure to please. Great spot if you are craving something sweet!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"It was my brother's request to throw down on some ice cream here. It was over 100 degrees outside, so making an ice cream stop was well worth it. It was crowded inside, so my family and I claimed the first available tables. The employees rushed to take our orders and were probably overwhelmed. I ordered chocolate chip ice cream inside a chocolate chip cookie sandwich. I savored every bite and didn't let any drip onto the table. It was one of the best ice creams I had eaten! It was interesting to learn that two Asian chicks left Wall Street to follow their culinary dreams of opening up Sweet Republic.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,4

"Hands down, literally the best ice cream in all of the Phoenix East Valley. They have a great selection of flavors, some more unique than others, but their staff is always accommodating when you'd like to sample. You can really taste the quality in their ice cream, which I love. My favorites are their almond butter crunch, lavender honey, earl grey and their green tea. What really sold me, was their waffle cones! Made fresh on site, and they aren't like your typical ice cream shop waffle cones. They're a lot more lighter and crisp. I visit so often and I wished they did punch cards.. Also love that Sweet Republic is carried at my local Whole Foods store, which is a bonus!",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5

"Why oh why didn't I look at Yelp before coming here. Perhaps because the smell off freshly made crepes was enticing. We stood on a fairly long line with a gal, bun in hair, ring through nose and a nasty attitude. Not ,""may I help the next person?"", but what do you want and move down. Doughy tasteless crepe with green bananas. You can't mess up nutella so that saved it. She put the topping two inches away from edge so you just had one mouthful of dough after the other. No and No save yourself the trouble and go get something tasty from a bakery.",unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,1

"I'm going to start this off by saying this is my temporary review of Donut Bar. It's October 2nd, 2019, and after an accidental overcharge this morning, I'll be visiting again several weeks from now for some complimentary donuts per the owner and employee named Olivia. I basically only review donut shops. I literally start most days with a donut and coffee, typically a maple bacon variety. I hope my first experience here was just an outlier, and next time is more enjoyable for me. I gave a star for presentation alone, and a star for the fact my sister loved her vegan CrÃ¨me BrÃ»lÃ©e donut. However, I honestly can't give a star for my Brad Fritter. It was almost flavorless at times. I went through large bites of nothing but borderline undercooked dough; which I spit out. It was rather unpleasant considering what I was anticipating. The fritter itself lacked any real sweetness, for such a large and doughy item, it just didn't work. The only sweetness was from the maple glaze; which I was searching for, because it was delicious when present, but it was scarcely drizzled. The item suffered because of this. There was definitely a generous portion of bacon, but again the fritter truly lacked that sweetness to balance that savory. More maple drizzle or a glaze would have done wonders. I might have even powered through the doughy parts. I only ate the bacon and crispy exterior. When I return I'll prob just try the maple bacon bar, or something seasonal, assuming they honor the free donuts. Cheers to second chances in a few weeks or so!",unknown,Negative,Positive,unknown,2

"Extremely hard to find. It's located under an escalator at a dead-end area of the casino. Unless you walk all the way to the front door of the Venetian theater and turn around (it'll be behind you) then you could easily spend 30 minutes searching for it (like I did.) Another reviewer said it's near Lux Cafe...not really. It's a good bit away from it. The casino signs for it stop when you're still too far away to find it, and casino staff seemed not to have heard of it. I asked two - one sent me to the Lux Cafe bakery; the other tried to send me to the restaurant, which is located on another floor. Fairly pricy. Service was average; staff let a drunk woman cut in front of me and said nothing about it. They got my order wrong, but fortunately I checked my bag, and they did fix it when I asked. But the biggest reason for 2 stars: Seriously underwhelming pastry. I ordered a macaron, TKO (Thomas Keller Oreo), a bouchon, a croissant, and a mini almond loaf, and coffee. The only things I would have ordered again are the coffee (not exceptional but good) and the almond loaf, which was quite tasty if not ideally fresh. The TKO was decent but too sweet - that white chocolate ganache didn't blow me away. I'm pretty damn sure that everything except possibly the TKO was not baked that same day. I went around 11 AM; perhaps things are better/fresher earlier?",unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,2

Awesome ice cream alert! I love that Honey Hut makes different flavors throughout the year. The seasonal fall/winter flavors are my favorite! This place is a hidden gem. Just walk up and get whatever ice cream you have a taste for and then grab a seat on the nearest picnic table. In the summer this place can get packed! They also close during the cold months so get as much ice cream as you can while they are open for the season.,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"After seeing other yelpers checking in at this place, we figured we would give this place a try on a Friday night. For ice cream, it is all vanilla base. Then you pick a flavor, a topping and an ingredients and they will create one just for you. You have a choice of having it on a waffle cone or a cup. I picked the waffle cone (and I regret it later because it was too much and messy). They also sell unique drinks that I would like to try next time. Since it was my first time, I ordered one from premade menu (I think it was called Oreo something). It took them at least 15 minutes to make the ice cream, but we did not mind to wait since it was a Friday night. If you want to go in and out of there, just keep that in mind. I also tried a sip of the Strawberry Macha Latte. It has a unique taste to it, but I am not sure if I would order it for me. Overall, the service was friendly, prices are a bit high but once again I love local businesses. I will come back to try something else again",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,3
"Super disappointed in this bakery!! Was here last night waiting in a 30 minute+ line with 2 kids only to be told when ordering that there were no more cannolis left. Okay so it was 630 pm, I get it! You're only well known for these things but whatever. I asked the cashier after buying some cookies since we were waiting so long when he recommends coming back for them and he said...8 am is the best time when we open. So here we are at 8 am only to be told that ""today they are only serving it in evening!"" Three things: 1) let people know when they are waiting in line when something is out... 2) train your staff on being accurate and truthful on your bakery and when things are available 3) really? No cannolis in your bakery but available online... I'll pass!",unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,1

The prices seem to be a tad lower than California prices so that's appreciated. Cashier was nice and friendly. Tip: order drinks and pay from the machine so you do not wait for it after you pay for the baked goods. Did that right when I walked in, then walked thru the baked items and while in line to pay, my drink was done. Love their zebra milk tea.",Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,4

Service is top notch and quick! Little walk up window where you order and pick up with little benches outside to munch out on. May be a line but don't be discouraged it goes quickly. Oh and flavors for the ice cream are ridiculously delicious. They have a doughnut (fresh) that they stuff with ice cream of your choice with toppings.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5

"I walk by here (ironically to get to the gym!) and have been curious to check out the spot. It looks charming from the window. We were down that way for an errand with the pup, so hubs waited with pupster, while I went in. Hubs asked for something of his own or forewarned me that he would eat whatever I got. Noted. The cafe has an old world feel. Think a dark Viennese cafe. I made my way to the counter and saw so many beautiful cakes. Alas, cakes aren't practical for grab and go errand type. The brownies were huge and would fit the size criteria of a shared treat. Then I looked up and saw what I thought were whoopie pies (gobs for Western Pennsylvanians). I read closer and they're cookies with peanut buttercream filling. Done! We sat on the bench outside and shared the tasty treat. The buttercream was light and greatly paired well with the chocolate chip cookie. It was a bit messy to eat, but so good. Pupster enjoyed hanging on the bench, too!",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5

From the crop one of the notables was the poptart donut. An entire poptart in a donut. I was skeptical but it turns out to be a winner. A few others that were tasty was the butter beer which was enormous and the creme brulee. Also the ladies who work there are very friendly. Very nice donut shop.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,4

"True Rating: 3.5 Sweet and Savory My friends have hyped up this place for a while now, so I decided to check this place out the past MDW. I ordered the cereal milk ice cream with corn flakes and hot fudge. The ice cream base in my opinion was just ok. I am usually into creamy ice creams, but this my friends was not. However, I did enjoy the toppings. The corn flakes were sprinkled with salt and super crunchy as for the hot fudge it was not too overwhelming and loved the fact that they used dark chocolate. Final Verdict: It's okay.",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,3

I remember visiting my uncle and going to Jarlings Custard Cup as a child. I'm an adult now and it was just as delicious as I remember!

"Mitchell's has some really good ice cream. I mean, it's no East Coast Custard, but the variety almost makes up for it. There are tons of unique choices each time, and plenty of old standbys. The Ohio City location is cool. Nice and roomy and bright, and the train that goes around the restaurant is soothing. It is best to go to the second floor, where you can watch them making ice cream. And a perk is that it stays open til midnight on weekends. Score after a few beers at Nano Brew!",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"Raspberry Macaroon! SOOOO DELICIOUS! They have lots of other pastries and cakes here, but the only thing I ever bought from them are their macaroons because it's just soo good. The outside has the perfect crispness, and the inside is soft, moist, and chewy. The chocolate macaroon tastes like a brownie, but wayyyy better than any normal brownie. I wish I had bought more than just 2 macaroons now :(.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Very busy and unorganized! Grab a number, weave your way to the display case to look at the eye candy and wait about 20+ min in a small cramped shop for your number to be called. I ended up getting a lobster tail, California cheesecake, and crumb cake. Waited another 15+ min for my name to be called so I can pay. There isn't a line for anything, so you really need to pay attention what they're calling out. Ended up being around $25 for those three items. Lobster tail was eh, cream was bland and the pastry was crispy to the point where it was hard. California cheesecake was nothing special or unique. The crumb cake was the most disappointing, it tasted like a dry sponge with brown sugar lumps on top, not even kidding. Don't waste your time or money here.",Negative,Negative,Negative,unknown,2
"I went here the other day with my sister and I was surprised by how unique the flavors were! The place itself was designed really nicely and they even offer an aesthetic backdrop for your boba drinks and ice cream. I got the matcha & strawberry with boba and it was so good, it was a little sweet so the next time I come back I'm probably going to have to lessen the sweetness, and my sister got a rose milk tea latte with boba, which was also surprisingly good. Not only were the drinks delicious, but the service was extremely good and the workers were very friendly! Overall, it's definitely a place worth checking out.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"While walking by the Strip, we've stopped at the Venetian for lunch and happened to pass by Carlo's Bakery. I used to walked Cake Boss on TLC, so just for nostalgia's sake, I decided to get some treats here. Good: I really wanted to say it lives up to the hype, but it doesn't. If you go during the day, the line up is pretty long, so go in the evening and you'll wait less. The service was good and the staff was courteous. Location is pretty clean too. Bad: I've gotten 2 cannoli, one dipped in chocolate and one regular. The chocolate one had a dry and waxy taste, which wasn't awful but wasn't pleasant neither. It just didn't taste fresh. I've had better cannolis from Italian pastry shops back in Montreal. At $4 a piece, it's still pretty hefty for a mediocre pastry. Bottom line: me thinks not. I don't think I would go back and wait in line again. The other food didn't look tempting neither, so I don't think I'd be interested in trying anything else.",unknown,Negative,Positive,unknown,2
French pastries - YES! I've tried numerous pastries at Amelie's and my favorites must be their macarons. By god the seasonal pumpkin macaron is like tasting everything there is to love about the fall season in a few small bites. Just wonderful. I love to bring out-of-towners here after dinner to pick up goodies to take back to the house for later. One of my favorite things about Charlotte for sure.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! The treats here are good, but with all the other places in the city to get sweets, take your money somewhere else where they will be happy to have you. I work downtown and have visited this shop numerous times and have yet to have a pleasant experience with the staff. The teenagers working there are too busy on their phones to care about helping you. I visited a few minutes before close and was immediately met with annoyance. It was made very clear the girl behind the counter didn't want to help me and wanted me to leave - I left empty handed and won't be going back.",Negative,unknown,Negative,unknown,1
"The sign for a box of 6 assorted flavored macarons said $15. But I got charged $17.50. It's bad business to put up a sign for one price and overcharge it when my card is rung up. That's fraudulent sales practices. I won't be going back to get ripped off again...and no, the sales tax is not 16.67% in Vegas.",unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,1
"After the long wait, I finally reached this place with my gf. The first thing that surprised me was that this place was a small stand, rather than a shop itself. I was a bit bummed. The pastries didn't look all that either. Ay other care or even a planera is much better. We ordered a vanilla and eggnog macaron along with their red velvet cupcake. The macarons are large in size for $3.50 and didn't have an eye popping flavor or bite to it. I prefer Paulette's up in SF. The cupcake was in cool temp that the cake was stiff and the frosting sucked. Something unique with it was the inside filling of cream cheese. It compared to whole foods cupcake lol. Bottom line, this place is over rated I feel. This is nothing toooo special. I won't be coming back.",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,3
"This place is fabulous the Cookie Monster flavor is the best ice cream I've had in a while and they also have unicorn poop and play doh flavor- AND KARAOKE, OKAY? Oh if you're not a child like me they also have lavender flavor and it's amazeballs",Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,5
"I grew up in Charlotte and i must say that this place is King of Desserts. My very favorite is the macaroons and the chocolate Eclairs.. Yummy . they pile on the chocolate and Custard.. OMG. they are delicious.. a little bit pricey but if you want the real thing then this place is where you'll find almost any thing that you can imagine or something you have not had in 20 years,.. yep.. it's here.. I gave them a 5 because they deserve it. i cant think of any other place even close to where i live that has the variety of baked goodies. my sister goes there weekly and brings over a lot of great things from this place.. I am so glad that they are in Charlotte and especially that they are open 24/7..i dont understand that especially being on that side of Charlotte but hey its good to know that they're in town. i only wish there was a Amelie's French Bakery in the Gaston county area. I am from Mount Holly and i would buy much more from them if there were a little closer to my home..As far as what i have eaten there its definitely a 5 star..Please open up another bakery in Gaston county someday.. i really hope you would do that. you would rock this town and there would be no competition that could come close to what you guys serve. i mean it. there are a few wanna be bakeries in Gastonia but their pastries are made early in the morning and by 5 0r 6 PM its old and not Fresh. Stale in other words. I would say their name but i would not want to embarrass them or humiliate the company.. they are so-so but not the real thing like you have.. and lastly..your food is always FRESH...Thanks for being part of Charlotte and NoDa....",unknown,Positive,Negative,unknown,5

"I am an ice cream lover and actually very snobbish when it comes to good ice cream My wife and I in our travels always look for local favorites wherever we go and let me tell you, we both believe Mitchell's by far is superior to any we have tried. We are temporarily living in Columbus and Graeter's is the end all here- not anywhere close to Mitchell's in terms of its creative flavors and good tasting, creamy, and flavorful ice cream. My favorite flavors are Rocky Road and the Bing Chocolate Cherry chunk- never can decide which to have so I always get the Taster's duo. Cleveland's- feel fortunate that you have Mitchell's- some cities we have visited have no locally made ice cream at all- their idea of good ice cream are chains. To the Mitchell Brothers- PLEASE think about expanding to Columbus- we miss you!!!!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
Expensive soft serve - it was good though! I was pleasantly surprised at how well the corn flakes went with the ice cream.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4

"I told you I was going back. Same great service. Same delicious food. I tried something new though. It's called Salty Caramel Chocolate Brownie. It was delicious. Brian said that it's an award winner and I must say, I agree with him. It's something that everybody needs to try. Get on it.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"The best place to go if you're looking for a place to relax and not feel guilty about stuffing your face with baked goods sent from heaven. My go to is always the eclairs - whether you get chocolate, vanilla, or caramel, there are no misses! But. I tried the infamous salted caramel brownies last night for the first time - and they definitely live up to the hype. There's more to this bakery than meets the eye - no seriously, I couldn't believe how big the place was - and no matter what you order, you'll leave happy!",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Can't go wrong with this place. We've been here a few times and I always get the same thing (small chocolate ice cream in a cone) but now that I'm reading other reviews, i NEED to switch it up and try something else. Plenty of parking for this sweet little place.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"I read about this place on The Pioneer Woman blog, and when Peter and I planned a visit to Ikea we decided to make a stop. We split a Croque Monsier. It was tasty, but next time we come here (the will be a next time for sure!) I'd probably try something else, or skip lunch altogether and just pick up some dessert. We got quite a selection of baked goods, and would order most again. We had some macarons and a salted caramel brownie at the actual restaurant. We both loved the pistachio, but the orange and lemon tasted a little bit like Fruit Loops and seemed stale compared to the pistachio. We took home a box full of goodies (another brownie, an eclair, a chocolate croissant, two more macarons, and a petit four) that we ate over the next couple of days. All were delicious. Peter said the eclair was exactly what an eclair should be. My favorite was the salted caramel brownie, it was heaven. I am a sucker for anything salty, especially sweet and salty, so this is no surprise. It was totally worth a stop, but I wouldn't make a special trip to Charlotte just to eat here.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"Great drink and dessert options. Opened 24 hours which makes it a nice place get work done. Finding a good spot can get tricky at times. Still, it's always an experience when I come here.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"Being from Youngstown, I was thrilled when I heard Handel's was opening in Las Vegas...and a mere two blocks from my house. The new location reminds me of the ones in Y'town....walk-up windows, no seating....great ice cream. Some are a little richer or sweeter than I'd like (choc. peanut butter and chocolate raspberry truffle), so I stick with chocolate malt w caramel, banana creme pie, chocolate pecan, or chocolate marshmallow. The only two downsides: the walk-up and the wait. That said, that's how it is in Youngstown, so why expect different here?",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Now I know where to come to get gelato, if we haven't churned any ice cream at home. The girl at the counter was very sweet with C and patent with him. Had I let him, he would have wanted to try all the flavors. Lol Their flavors are outstanding. Favorites bring cinnamon toast crunch, captain crunch, and whiskey Irish cream. Now if only we can replicate those flavors at home, ice cream life would be amazing. Lol",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Suggested to us by a security guard, a couple blocks of The Fremont Street Experience. You see the picture, delectable. A little pricey, but it is Vegas.... Well worth every penny. Don't often crave a donut, bit glad I did today. Walking distance, close to hotel, perfect. Well worth your text and Penny's, priceless!!!!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Love this place, cool options and good options for those not too adventurous. Tasty ice cream so fresh and I had the coffee float with sesame ice cream DELICIOUS!",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"We don't have many Italian bakeries in Charlotte, so this place is a dessert-heaven sent! Do not leave here without getting one of their massive chocolate croissants (i know those are French and not Italian but my oh my!!)! If you're looking for a cake, the Italian Wedding Cake is marvelous. You can get cake by the slice or order an entire one to take home -- they've got a ton of flavors to choose from! I also love the pastries, like the turnovers and chocolate croissants (they're packed with so much chocolate and are so flaky). I'm a cannoli connoisseur, so I do have to say that I'm not a fan of their cannoli; the cream is a little thick and not as silky as I like a typical filling to be. But the bakery offers so many other tasty treats that I can't knock them on their cannoli alone. They're well staffed and very attentive to their customers. They're situated off the road with a huge gravel parking lot, so you don't have to worry about trying to find a space -- pick up is easy.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"If you're a donuts fan, this is a must-stop shop during your trip to Vegas! You'll be surprised how big half of their donuts are! Yes, you'll also want to order one just to see if it's possible to finish one. Plus, they have very appealing regular sized donuts, so you may as well order one of those as well! I am also curious if the fish tank has real donuts at the bottom or fake ones - that was the hot debate in our group. I still say no way those were real! Bonus tip, use the restroom before you leave for the wall art!",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
The donuts were awesome! Great there early the sell out fast We got the nutella donut it was amazing,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
Spent $18 on 2 dry tasteless cookies and 2 Brownies that we're dry and old- very disappointing! Don't waste your $$,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,1
"Having heard so much about it, and being a complete sugar-head, I REALLY wanted to like this place. It's open 24 hours and the caramel salted brownie is quite good. But, after 3 visits, I have tried several pastries and cakes and they are just ok at best and at worst kind of tasteless and spongy/heavy. The desserts are chilled and for some of them it makes them worse for the wear-- such as anything that is supposed to be flaky. Cute decor does not make up for mediocre sweets. I have yet to try their lunch/breakfast offerings, so maybe this is what keeps other reviewers so enthused.",Positive,Negative,unknown,unknown,2

Great delicious flavors of ice cream. And can try a bunch in a sample muffin pan dish!,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"My sisters were not impressed with the crack pie at all . It is extremely sweet but nothing special. Taste like raw Dough. Just tasted like sugar Cookies taste better but they aren't that great either It wasn't amazing but it was dry !!!! Milkshake was good. Coffee is good to me cold brewed but some people aren't into the sour taste . Overall, a spot that doesn't hit the spot as much as you have expected",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,3
I had the mint chocolate chip sundae!! I words can't describe! It was amazing and very satisfying. It was so good!! And the chocolate chip cookie was very good as well. It was thick and buttery - melted in your mouth!,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"I've been here twice now and I have to say, Churn is delicious. I had Vietnamese Coffee and the Carrot Cheesecake ice cream and I was not disappointed. I think the Vietnamese Coffee ice cream is the best ice coffee ice cream I've ever had! They used condensed milk and espresso. They also give you an option to add toasted marshmallow fluff, which is absolutely perfect for anyone with a sweet tooth. I am sensitive to anything that is too sweet, so I stuck to a single scoop for $2.75. This place is a must try. They are open till 10pm on Sundays, which is later than other places around.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Sometimes when you go to these places that are highly reviewed or have a lot of publicity, you have a small letdown. But honestly I having eaten a lot of ice cream in my day and it was the best Sunday I've ever had. I will be back.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5

And I've gotten my kids the Teddy Bear Custard Cup a couple of times, its cute. They love it and its pretty cheap. Its just a regular cup of custard with like 5 teddy grahams stuck in the custard and you can add banana or nuts or whatever.",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"On the Las Vegas Strip, The Linq Walkway filled with stores, restaurants, and fun things to do in Las Vegas. The High Roller Wheel is located towards the end of the Linq Walkway depending on which entrance you enter. It is right next to the parking lot. They have fun restaurants like Sushi Burrito, Gordon Ramsey Fish and Chips, Chayo Mexican Restaurant, and Sprinkles. Sprinkles is one of the dessert places on the Walkway. Sprinkles serves Ice Cream, Cookies, and Cupcakes. You can go inside the store to buy your craving, but if there is too long of a line or you don't want to talk to someone, located next to the store is Sprinkles' Pink Vending Machine. You can buy cookies and cupcakes from the vending machine, but there's not a large range of flavors than ordering inside the store. My friend wanted a Cupcake for her break from work, so I went to Sprinkles. Unfortunately, there was a long line inside the store, but luckily the line at the vending machine had only one other customer. From the section they offered, I ordered the Red Velvet Cupcake. It came in a cute package and the cupcakes had a cute design also. My friend really enjoyed the cupcake. The flavors they serve depends on the day of the week so what you saw online might not be serve that day, so make sure to have back up.",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,5
"If you would like to go to an average frozen custard place with the trademark response to any issue ""Sorry, can't do much! That's what the system is showing."", you're at the right place! Let me explain. I purchased a weekly special (parfait, $0.50 off). While purchasing, I informed the cashier that the amount she was telling wasn't the same amount the drive-through attendant told me. I got the trademark response. Without questioning her again, I bought it and went on my merry way. I wanted to double-check the price, so I called the next morning asking the regular price and weekly special price for comparison. Then I informed the incident to the person over the phone. And got a similar response ""Sorry can't do much now. I'll make sure to let others know."" You might think, it's only 50 cents. That's not the issue here. It's the principle! I have worked in the service industry before. Some places would above and beyond to keep their customers happy. I didn't see such an attitude from this place. Quite disappointed, tbh! I really wanted this place to be my go-to custard place .. but I guess you can't get everything you want in life!",unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,1
Walking the strip we wanted something sweet to snack on and something to wash it down with. We sampled the Better Nutter Cookie and Almond Chocolate Croissant (warmed up). If you love peanut butter you can't go wrong with the cookie. It was all sorts of peanut goodness. I'd recommend asking them to warm up your croissant - it melts in your mouth when you do! We had a Vanilla Latte and Iced London Fog (like an Earl Gray Tea Latte with Vanilla - but you have to ask for since it's not on the menu). Both were good.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"The Batch House is where The Batchmaker--Cristina Rojas--bakes her way through life, one delicious batch at a time. Recently, my loving wife surprised me with some treats from The Batchmaker--an oatmeal cream pie and a caramel apple cookie. The oatmeal cream pie was unlike any I've had before. I don't know what Cristina does to make the cream rich and moist but I hope other bakers figure it out because it is life changing.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"I'm definitely a big fan of Cake Boss and the artistic abilities and visions that Buddy creates. This little bakery is great in showcasing the great treats and desserts that Buddy is known for. I also love that you can see some of the pastry chefs in action. The staff are very nice and although the lines don't move too quickly at least you can watch the pastry chefs. However, I have been here twice now and still feel that the desserts are alright. I recently got an oreo lobster tail and a piece of red relvet cake. The lobster tail was way too crispy and the red velvet cake wasn't anything special. It's definitely worth going to at least once and to try out all the different options.",Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,3

"I was excited to try this place! I got the birthday truffles and I finished them in less than 1 minute haha. As a big fan of cookie dough, this tasted sooooo good. I considered buying the big pack after that, but I was going to the pool party at Marquee so it was not good timing. The next day, I came back and tried the cereal milk soft serve with corn flakes topping and I was hesitant to buy it since it was $6 for a super small cup but I'm so glad I did cause it was REALLY good. It was the perfect combo and even my bf liked it a lot!!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"I've been here multiple times and I would show up weekly just for the entertaining people-watching but the display case filled with delicious French pastries certainly helps! This place is usually busy and bustling so, if you're a first-timer, it's preferable if you come with an 'old pro' so you won't hold up the line trying to decide on what to order. My personal favorites? The famed salted caramel brownie, chocolate and plain croissants, any of the fruit tarts, and the macarons. I've never tried any of the soups or the sandwiches but my friends have all raved about them. I would skip the house coffee - nothing special about it all. Grab a seat in the atrium and enjoy the food/ambiance!",Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,4
"Just basing this review on the failed macarons.. I had high expectations heading to Bouchon for their macarons and was quite disappointed. My macarons had a paper thin spread of filling inside and weren't that great. I've had better ones. They are quite big and worth the price you pay for the size you do get compared to all of the other macaron shops I have tried. Will give it another try, but will try the Bouchon in Beverly Hills next time!",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,3

This is a fantastic ice cream place. The inside is incredibly clean and has a great decor. I sampled multiple flavors and they all were amazing. The wild berry crumble was so unique and tasteful though that I couldn't not pick it. All of my family got different flavors as well and they all loved them.,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5

"Found this place after eating AYCE Sushi. There is always place for desert with me. I'll let you guess how I found this place. It was via Yelp. I was towing a trailer with my car on it so it was a little bit hard to manuver around the side streets GPS was taking me but when I found it, I just parked it right in the front. Their lot was not big enough for my truck and trailer. Plus that evening when I went, it was packed. I got the peanut butter chocolate ice cream sundae with whip cream. Man it was good and rich. I loved every last scoop of it. The pricing here is fantastic. Its not over priced at all. I almost thought the price was wrong for a second but it wasn't. Other then that, I will be coming back here 100% when I'm in Cleveland and want pretty damn good ice cream I've ever had.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Save your money! I have heard rave reviews of Sprinkles cupcakes. I also watched every episode of Cupcakes Wars which the creator of Sprinkles cupcakes judges (now I think I will rethink her opinions). I got the cinnamon ""cupcake""...I use the term cupcake loosely since mine tasted more like a dense muffin. Even if I poured milk directly on it I doubt it would be moist. My friend ordered the vanilla cupcake with milk chocolate frosting, also nothing to write home about. Overall I was thoroughly disappointed since I LOVE sweets. There are plenty of other local cupcake shops that I would choose over this chain. If someone bought me another cupcake from Sprinkles I would try it in hopes of redeeming the name but I will not be spending my money on these MUFFINS again. Sorry Sprinkles....step it up!",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,2

"Love this bakery! Amelie has 3 locations in Charlotte but this is the only one that's open 24/7. Here's several highlights about this bakery: The salted caramel brownies are delicious! This is one of their best sellers... and I'd say that it lives up to the hype. I had the rose eclair on my last visit and while it was good, it didn't beat the brownies. I've been to this location multiple times and there's always a line to place an order. My last visit was on a Saturday around 8:30PM. There were probably about 15 people ahead of me. So if you're looking for a grab and go experience, this is not the place. The ambiance is very whimsical and cute. I love it! They have plenty of seating. Lots of people seem to come here to work. I've never done it so can't testify to the quality of their wifi or number of power outlets... however judging by the crowd, I can safely assume they do pretty good job on both.",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5

Delicious cupcakes. Excited they finally opened one here in Vegas. This location as already mentioned in other reviews is located at the Linq. We stopped by on a Friday night. It was quite busy as one can imagine. The ice cream section was busier than the cupcake area. I got one cupcake (black and white flavor) and one doggy cupcake. Mine was delicious and I can tell my doggy enjoyed his as well. I will most certainly be back. Only docked off one star because it's not the most convenient of locations to get to.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4

"This is a cute little spot in a shopping center off providence road. I wanted to check it out after seeing photos of the maiko special. I had no clue what the ingredients included were but I wanted to try it. Typically at a place like this, I stick with soft serve but I forced myself to venture out. The soft serve was great and the rest of it was good but for me it felt like there was too much going on. I think I'm the future I will stick to my usual choice of soft serve. They had some toast options too which looked pretty good.",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,4

"I can't give my full support to a place that reeks of snobbery and unsatisfactory ice cream. Don't get me wrong, it's DELICIOUS ice cream. But, instead of saying, ""That hit the spot."" afterwards, I (and my comrades) always end up saying something more like, ""Well now I want a f*cking truckload of ice cream. Should I get the triple scoop? No wait, I can't afford it. Damn."" Here's how to remedy falling into the unsatisfied trap: Completely overdo it. By upgrading to an ice cream sandwich, or an entrÃ©e-sized sundae with three flavors of ice cream, toffee, cookie pieces, brownie bites, torched marshmallows, hot fudge sauce, and the kitchen sink, you'll not only leave satisfied (and slightly ill, in a good way) but you'll get to appreciate why the place constantly basks in its own glory. All of the toppings and ice creams are house made, gourmet and covered in glittering, artisan snob dust. When was the last time you had an artisan, snob-dusted blow torched marshmallow? The verdict? Go big or don't go.",Negative,Positive,unknown,unknown,3
"AmÃ©lie's French Bakery was the place to be growing up in Charlotte. After a long night clubbing and eating too much cheese at the cheese and wine party, you tend to want something sweet at 4 in the morning. As big as Charlotte is, you'd think there'd be more 24/7 places. AmÃ©lie's has always been a staple delivering fresh handmade pastries, my favorites being the chocolate hazelnut tart and the salted caramel brownie. The workers are always helpful and don't mind telling you what things are. And after seeing the lines wrapped around the building, they still greet you with a smile. The only thing I hate is the parking, although it looks ample, you may be looping around a few times till someone leaves. This by no means will stop me from coming here or giving a 5 star.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"One of my fav. Cupcake shop!!! I'm so glad they open one here.. But wish it's not on the strip, so inconvenient to drive and park just to get some cupcakes. I hope they open another location on the southwest..hehe(closer to home). Tried a lot of different flavors and the only one I and my kids love most is the banana. I haven't try the ice cream yet, one of these day I'll. Don't buy the bring home and bake, it's not the same and a Waste of money!! Taste nothing like the ones they make in the store.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
A great donut shop! The donuts here aren't labeled but it doesn't really matter because they all look and taste delicious. I just sort of pointed at the twelve I thought looked the tastiest. Never would I think of eating four donuts in a day but I couldn't help myself with these!,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Awesome environment. Not a fan of the Elephant wars- tastes game-y... salted caramel brownies are always consistent, macaroons are delicious- but the Honey Butter flavor is the most awesome & it's seasonal :(",Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,3
"The best baked goods in the city - sweet and savory. For a group dessert, call and order one of their apple cakes. Ughhhh.. So good.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"We came to check out this place. The ice cream is ""ok"". Some ice crystals, and a little fake tasting. The scoop size is very disappointing, very small. Two scoops is actually like one normal scoop anywhere else. It was kinda weird to me but they give you your ice cream on a plate. (Unless they ran out of bowls or something) it made it a little difficult to eat as the ice cream melts. The girls working behind the counter were very friendly! Great customer service.",unknown,Negative,Positive,unknown,3
"This place was so awesome!! My sister & I were thinking of somewhere we could grab a dessert style drink or ice cream & this little gem popped up. It did not disappoint! My sister got the swirl ice cream in a cup with lucky charms cereal blended with the ice cream & lucky charms on top. I ordered the sweet matcha tea! Both were so delicious! I am typically not a fan of ice cream, but I have to say this was so good, I will definitely be back again! I highly recommend you stop in here and check it out for yourself. It's a very clean place and there are so many options when it comes to what you want. I want to try their strawberry cheesecake swirl next! Someone in front of us got it & it looked so good. The prices are fair, we paid just under $13 for both items, now thats a deal! Stop by & get your dripps on!",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
Great flavor. The donut with ice cream it is so good. The ice cream melts nicely. We might think it sounds too sugary but it balances the flavors.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
Great pastries but they need more baker or staff or something always have to wait for the things I want,unknown,Positive,Negative,unknown,3
"Donuts galore, people! Donuts galore! I have a major weakness for 3 things: fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies, chocolate fudge cake, and donuts. These donuts are not for the faint of heart! They are 3x the size of a normal donut packing in lots of sweetness and an explosion of flavor! They sold me on the sugar donut topped with homemade whipped cream and strawberries (which I split, rather reluctantly!) while my friend also took a vanilla donut to go. Their donuts are fresh and soft and perfect for the start of a Monday.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Since this was probably our only opportunity to try the famous Milk Bar, we decided to go for the tasting. The cake pop was incredibly sweet (as I think most are), The soft serve with corn flakes was good, the cookie was just ok, and the crack pie was very good. Probably wouldn't return to spend that much unless it was for the pie.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,3
"I wish I had more to say, but here's my endorsement: I am lactose intolerant, and the Chocolate Shoppe is so good that I don't even care. Every flavor I've ever had here outweighs the pain. A tiny bit pricy, but some things are worth it. I also love that they have a location in the West Towne Mall.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Not worth the hype!!! The cereal milk soft serve tasted odd (they were also cheap on the fudge) and the cake offerings were over the line sweet, making them not enjoyable. You're better off somewhere else for dessert!",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,2
"5 stars for my Napoleon and coconut macaroons. 0 stars for the customer service. Some of the pastries aren't labeled and when I asked about a specific one I was told: ""it's just a brownie"". Gee, thanks, pal. The cashier made us feel bad for wanting Seagrams ginger ale instead of Boylans; saying Seagrams had no ginger in it. Also, I asked for extra milk in my cafe au lait only to be asked, ""do you just not want coffee in it?"". I don't get the elitist coffee culture happening. Atmosphere is bizarre, the place looks like a modge podge of leftover furniture and arts and crafts projects gone wrong. Overall, don't ask questions and get a dessert to go.",Negative,Positive,Negative,unknown,5
Great ice cream. Tastes super fresh and I like the little Chinese take out containers. One weird complaint; the spoons! They're like a prank of some kind - bending so much you can barely snag a mouthful. But go there anyway...,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
I've been to both locations a few times. I tried the cotton candy macaroon on my last visit and I fell in love with it. I ended up eating about 5 while sitting there at 4am,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
I have now visited Villani's 4 times and every time Has always been a great experience. The Italian cream cake is excellent. Other items that I would recommend are the Lemon Bars and Oatmeal Raisin Cookies. This is now my go to bakery.,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"I'm probably the only person in Charlotte that hasn't visited Amelie's and shame on me. I stopped in for a desert and coffee on a Saturday afternoon. The pastry selection here was awesome. There is a one problem though, How do you choose? I had at least 3 items that I didn't think I could leave without. The coffee was also excellent. The service was friendly and fast. The decor is very eclectic and cool. Lots of different places to sit, with different tables and chairs, inside, outside, etc. A great place to stop in and just hang out for a bit, relax and grab a bite. I can't wait to come back and try a sandwich.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
Delicious! We had Dough melts. I ordered Cookie Monster ice cream with Oreo cookie topping. The glazed donut was warm and soft. Great customer service! They also offer flights. They had an ice cream with bacon that was savory and so good. I can't wait to go back. This place is awesome I'm happy we have this in Phoenix.,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Nice wide layout, quite spacious while looking at the goodies. wished they had a few more table seating, considering this being a new area and all. Good chocolate, still prefer my Lindt.",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,3
Prices seemed fair. 2 cannoli and two iced mochas were under around $10. The wait was very long despite how many employees were there it seemed only a few were actually getting anything done. One woman helped our group of 4 and when I tried getting a young mans attention to add to our order he told me that I would need to talk to the woman helping us. The cannoli was amazing though and so was the iced mocha. Everything in the place looked fantastic. If I ever find myself back in Cleveland I will surely spend more time in little Italy.,Positive,Positive,Negative,unknown,4
"We taste tested 6 donuts. The grilled cheese and French toast were warm and delicious. None of the other donuts we taste tested were edible. By far Not the best donuts in the world........ Creme brÃ»lÃ©e was greasy, topping too hard and too thick, and cream was almost nonexistent. JJust about broke a tooth. Bought two because of the hype. Waste of money. If you're charging premium $$$$$ at the very least don't go cheap on the cream........ Bacon apple fritter was hyped. Horribly bland, almost no cinnamon and no apples. Horribly hard. Nothing was fresh. Everything was hard. Chocolate deluxe was all yeast with just chocolate on top. Nothing special. Wasn't fresh. Everything tasted like yesterday's donuts. And btw, we came early hoping to get them fresh for fair taste test. Last but not least, poor selection. More donut selection and much fresher at DD. Better value too. If you can't produce consistently high quality then don't charge high prices...... And don't hard stuff my dog wouldn't eat. Toss them, don't sell em.....",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,3
"This is the place I always suggest to visitors! I always want to take them to Amelie's because of the different vibe, unique decor, and delicious food. It just seems to be a Charlotte staple. I have tried several of the different pastries and desserts but I always end up landing back on the French Macaroons - my favorite: the pistachio (although I liked it better before they started adding the pistachio pieces on the outside, I think the extra baking of the pistachios changes their flavor). Anyway, I thought this was a great place to come and do homework when I was in graduate school, as it allowed for me to chill with my headphones or have group study sessions. The tricky part is timing. I have gone in with no line, and I have gone in other times and the line is wrapped into the other rooms of the building. Seating can also be tricky as well due to popularity.",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
The little store front was right at the entrance between TI and the Venetian so it caught my eye. I had a raspberry and a pistachio macaroon. They were perfect and large in size; I thought they were fairly priced at $3.50. The young man working was very friendly and had a great sense of humor!,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
Yes I will give Amelie's five stars for their fresh delivery of their pastries. Salted caramel brownie is number one. However the sandwiches are pricey for 1 to 2 ounces of meat. Also I remember previously hearing about the employees being mistreated and not paid overtime and I do not like supporting businesses that mistreat employees.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,3
Mitchells is #1 in Cleveland. That's all I can say. The flavors are unreal. The freshness is crazy. The amaretto cookie is just stupid tasty.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Fun space in a very charming part of Ohio City. It's mature tree lined on a one way street. There is parking off street or on the south side of the building. Mind you, we went on a Saturday night. The line was massive. After waiting 40 minutes, I was super excited for my choice. And wouldn't you know it, the person in front of me got the last of it! Me and my big trap shouldn't have told my BF why I was so excited to try it ....grrr. So the lady was super nice about having me try samples but was deflated and no longer excited. The ice cream we got was very good. Portions are the kind that make you wish you would have ordered two. Not sure if I will ever wait that long again. But would like to give it another shot",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"Omg this place is absolutely amazing with their fresh mad ice cream and delicious cookie cup! They have an original and unique selection of ice cream flavors that are all so delicious! I have been a few times since I moved to Arizona and will keep going back! So glad I found this place! The cookie cup has your choice of ice dream, your choice in flavor of macaroon cookie on top, then topped with a crisped marshmallow! Absolutely amazing creation!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"I feel like this place is overhyped. The first time i had it, my boyfriend bought me a box of different pastries and it was okay and expected more. Second time I ordered cake for his birthday and side desserts. It tasted stale and wasn't worth the price. Haven't been back since and i don't think I ever will.",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,2
This place is so good!!! And the store manager that works there is so friendly. My girlfriend and I went here during one of our date nights and we had some ice cream and it was delicious. Can't wait to go back,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"I watched Christina Tosi as a master chef judge and was curious to try her desserts. Although the hype for this place is good, the prices are outrageous, however the quality is better than other dessert places I been to. And for the size of the dessert, it's a no go for the price. I got the bite sized cookie dough flavored confetti and it was really good, it was one of their truffles. The others were the cookies and they tasted kind of like any other cookie but with a different flavor than your typical cookie. The three cookies ran for $11 and the flavors were confetti, marshmallow and blueberry. The cookie truffle was 7$ and you get three small balls. It was definitely an experience that will be remembered. Was it worth the price tag? Hell No! But was it worth the experience. Yes! I would say give it a one time try and call it quits. I wouldn't go back, but the dessert is very good. Service was nonchalant. The employee that served me was kind of boring and annoyed about the pandemic, but pretty much everyone is. They wore gloves as well as having a clear shield in front so you don't come in contact with the employee. It's a mess but it is part of history for us folks.",unknown,Positive,Negative,unknown,4

Bake for Hope is a charity that is raising breast cancer awareness and providing proceeds of nationwide bake sales to local Susan G Komen for the Cure affiliate offices. On this Saturday, Bake for Hope will be there to sell our delicious homemade cupcakes, brownies, and cookies. It is the PERFECT pairing- cake and ice cream!",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,5
"During a recent business trip, my friend and I visited Bouchon Bakery (one of the three in the Venetian) for an early breakfast. I was amazed by the selection, but settled for a strawberry croissant and two of their spherical beignets. The croissant was buttery and full of strawberry goodness...better yet, the two small beignet orbs will filled with raspberry jam and were fantastic. A wonderful, small breakfast to start the day!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Confetti Cake!!!!!!!! First, I want to make it clear that I'm not a cake person, BUT this cake is to die for. It was sooo damn good I didn't even have a moment to take a picture of it. It has magical crunchies inside every bite. It was nothing like I ever expected. 10/10 I would recommend to everyone and their mothers. It was so yummy I came back the next day to try the strawberry short cake and once again I was blown away.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Sweets were pricey but didn't try. I didn't expect anything out of their savory food because I just wanted a quick bite for dinner but my dad and I got a pizza which was ok/solid, pasta which was good, and the stromboli was amazing!!! It was just presented on the side of the place and we said screw it just microwave it for us but it ended up tasting super good? Meat strombolis are good but for some reason I reallllly liked the veggie one. Highly recommend.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4

Cinnamon roll shake was amazing!!! As well as the chocolate PB. Prices are fair. I'll definitely be back again.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
So I went here on 2 occasions. 1st visit I would have given a 4 star for delicious rasberry macroon and white chocolate mocha. 2nd visit I would have given a 2 star for hard pastry and giving me a latte instead of a mocha; even when I brought it to their attention they insisted it was a mocha not a latte; which for anyone that drinks coffee knows there is a clear difference..,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,3
"YUM ALERT YUM ALERT!!!!! I. Love. The Chocolate Shoppe. All the flavors are delicious, but I especially recommend the Coconut Almond Bliss and the Cake Batter Fudge. Sometimes the employees aren't that friendly, but hey, everyone has their bad days!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Typical Chinese bakery with several dozen kinds of pastries, cakes, and drinks. Obviously popular, most customers carried trays of selected pastries lining up to pay. As usual, most pastries were mild sweet, just the way I liked them. It's a perfect place to satisfy sweet and carbohydrates cravings. 4*Matcha Red Bean: only a few red beans on top, the rest was some kind of sponge cake and cream. 5*Taro Swirl: crispy and mild sweet, perfectly buttery!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"This place is THE BEST. I am addicted to matcha.. there is something about the grittiness bitter x sugar that I am obsessed with. Charlotte needs more asian fusion places if it really wants to be a diverse city so Matcha Cafe Maiko is a step in the right direction. Extra points for being in the suburbs so parking isn't hard. The matcha soft serve is premium grade- you can tell by the intensity of the color and how prominent the flavor is. Not a vanilla soft serve green tea ice cream you can get at a buffet but it ranks as high as Cha Cha Matcha in NYC. It packs a punch though so if you eat it on a weekend night expect to stay up for the next 6 hours. Also get the black sesame or hojicha ice cream, I actually feel like I'm in Japan. When I'm committed I will get the soft serve cone because they really top it high for you, but when I'm on the go I like getting the matcha float (they put matcha ice cream on top of matcha sugar water- it's good, I promise. They have a latte float version too but I can't handle so much dairy at once.) I wouldn't go there for the special though just because the way it's compiled makes it hard for you to mix the ice cream and the crunchy toppings. Anyway, was thinking of you Matcha Cafe Maiko so just thought I'd drop in and leave a review. Keep being amazing and come to the Triangle area thank you. Would give y'all 6 stars if I could",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Super sweet staff that offers suggestions if you are on the fence, worth coming here for their ice cream or unique sundae combos!",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Although nothing bizarre, the conservative type flavors are still solid choices. My favorites were Italian Cherry and Cookies and Mint. Everything was good, but those two really stood out. The creaminess of the ice cream is key to the ice cream's success. The flavorings are also quite potent, which I like. Nothing breaks my heart more than mildly flavored ice cream. I wanted to try their shakes or sundaes, but I also needed to save room for elsewhere at the time. I did pick a pretzel cone for my scoop. The pretzel isn't bad, but it wasn't what I was expecting. Its not as crumbly as a traditional waffle cone. Its not necessarily as sweet either, but it does add an undeniably delicious saltiness to each bite.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
Great ice cream and neat environment. Brought some out-of-town guests and they loved it as well. Will be back!,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Cool (ha ha) place for ice cream. Good service but pretty pricey. We used a Groupon which took the bite (ha ha) out of it but it was still $12 for not very much. I wlll save this for special events. If you do not choose teh Daddy specials with the macaroon, you will save some dough but then it won't be so special...",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"Being from Youngstown, I was soooo excited to hear that Handel's was coming to Las Vegas. There is NOTHING like this here. DQ, Baskin Robbins...ICK. Ive had to settle for frozen yogurt. When you've had Handel's everything else mine as well be from the freezer section of the grocery store in a carton. Its just like home, stand outside and wait in line at a walk up window. I got my usual, a scoop of grape and a scoop of vanilla w oreo. YUMMY! Had some of Eds butter pecan....OMG so delish. The flavors are the same as Ohio (thank goodness). My reason for 4 stars is because the scoops seemed a lil skimpy compared to Youngstown which was a lil disappointing but my waistline thanks me :) Vegas....go treat yourself. If you love ice cream, there's NO DOUBT you will fall in love. Unsure what to choose from all the flavors? Just ask for a sample.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"After eating lunch at the Arrogant Butcher and a bit of walking around downtown Phoenix, me and my girlfriend headed back to her place in Scottsdale; but made a quick stop at Sweet Republic to satisfy our craving for something sweet. Upon walking in I had no idea just how famous this place was, until I saw a wall covered in press articles of recognition & until I saw the ""As Seen on the Food Network"" stamped on their menu for one of their ice cream dishes, the ""Toffee Banofi"" a double scoop of Madagascar Vanilla, fresh bananas, almond toffee brittle & salted butter caramel sauce. The interior is modern; slightly reminding me of Pinkberry and its modern decor. There is the counter that contains the ice cream, sorbets, and pastries. There are tables and chairs both inside and outside. There is a help-yourself water dispenser which came in handy after I got thirsty from eating 2 scoops of ice cream. There is also a stack of board games, near the water dispenser, to choose from and play with as you enjoy your ice cream at the tables. I admit that I'm boring when it comes to my preference for ice cream flavors. I tend to choose either vanilla or chocolate (or rocky road if I'm feeling adventurous). So surprise, surprise I ordered a scoop of their Madagascar Vanilla + a scoop of their Belgian Chocolate. You can definitely taste the quality and care that went into making these flavors. I personally preferred the Belgian Chocolate over the Madagascar Vanilla since the flavor was a bit more developed. I was able to sample the Horchata and the Espresso which were good but probably a bit too much for me had I ordered a scoop. Had I not been so full from lunch I would've liked to try the ""Campfire S'more"" a double scoop of Belgian Chocolate, roasted marshmallow & hot fudge in a waffle bowl but I suppose this is just one of many reasons to re-visit Arizona again!",Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,4
"I can't even begin to explain how much I love this place. Their baked goods are unlike any baked goods you've had before and I can promise you that. This location is new, but we used to drive all the way from Las Vegas to their location in Irvine, CA to spend $50 worth of stuff to bring home and snack on for a week. It was costly, but that's why I'm so happy to have a bakery so close by now. The layout of their operation is great too. No more waiting in line while servers rush to bring all of your items together. Grab a tray, grab some tongs, and pick up all the things you want, then bring the tray to the cashier for checkout. They will individually package each item for you if you're taking them to go. And every time I get to the checkout with a tray absolutely piled high with goodies, I'm always pleasantly surprised at how little it actually cost me. If you get the chance to try their coffees too, go for it! You will not regret coming here.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"By far my favorite local ice cream shop! It's a small place and there is usually a line, but it is worth it. My favorite flavor is the ""Sweet Cream,"" which they don't have on display. The atmosphere is great and the customer service has always been good too!",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"We got a Pain au Raisin and Banana Nut Muffin with 2 coffees. They were good, but given the expensive price tags, it's only 3stars worthy. Honestly I've had better pastries. BTW, you can't charge it to the room because they are not associated with the hotel! Lame!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,3

My boyfriend and I love coming in for pints of ice cream to-go, along with our dessert for that night. You guys are the absolute best and the owner is so nice! Theres just one thing....the amount of times we have been craving a snow cone or some scoops of ice cream after 8pm is insane. We wish you guys would be able to find a way to stay open later, we know in Arizona a lot of people don't come out until the sun goes down. For the summer you should look into this maybe as the sun will be going down at 8pm. We can't wait to enjoy your delicious food again.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5

"Presti's. We've been coming here for for over 25 years. Kathy has been coming here even longer than that (I think add at least another 20 years, shh). I think they do a very good job with lunch items and their prices are reasonable. Coffee is decent and the baked goods are worth the calories and the price point is fair. I have other places in the area that I like more for baked goods, deli food, and coffee. However, no one has a combination of quality in all three off those categories, plus price, and pretty fast friendly service. And the clincher for Presti's is atmosphere. There's an ambiance I can only describe as a little worn, a little chic, a little hint of Cleveland attitude (in a good ""it is what it is"" kind of way), along with a dash of theatre. Or maybe that's the espresso kickin' in.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"Fun and charming atmosphere. The service is always good. Some of the lunch sandwiches are a little pricey but always delicious. I'm not thrilled with a lot of the desserts for the price. All the ones I've tried are just a disappointment. Too rich, or not as tasty as expected, and very pricey. One I do enjoy is the almond twice baked croissant. Drinks are all good and worth trying.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,4

"Amelie's is a great spot to catch up with friends, get work done, and satisfy your sweet tooth. We stop by Amelie's quite frequently to pick up a sweet treat or breakfast sandwiches. The interior is quite intriguing with the variety of colors and different design styles. It is spacious with a good amount of seating but it tends to get packed very quickly!! The lines wrap around since it's such a go to spot for many. Our favorites are their macarons (Pistachio and Salted Caramel) and their cinnamon sticks! As for breakfast sandwiches, we tend to do the build your own and customize it to our likings.",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"A great place to get your sugar fix after a nice dinner. No place to sit. No place to even put your food down for a second. Yes, the corn flakes in the vanilla ice cream was really good. Of course, the helpings look small, but it was plenty for two of us. Speed was good considering there was a line. Great place to try once if you are tourist.",Negative,Positive,unknown,unknown,3
"Because I stayed at the Venetian, it was inevitable that I passed this place every time I left/went to the room. After seeing the good reviews on yelp I decided to give it a try. $17.50 or so for a box of about 6? A bit pricey, but what isn't in Vegas? Out of all the flavors, I liked only the espresso one. It had a good amount of coffee taste to it, but not overwhelming. The filling used for these macarons are not overly sweet which tends to be the case with most places. But basically, all the other flavors with the exception of chocolate and espresso basically tasted to same to me. And maybe it was a bad batch, but out of the 6, I think half of them were hollow in the middle. Which is not how a properly made macaron should be. The girl that helped us was a bit slow? But maybe it's been a long day. Overall, they're alright. Not the best I've ever had. But if you must try something, I would definitely go for the espresso.",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,3
"Ice cream here is good but owners are NOT customer focussed. I have never been to an ice cream place that charges you ADDITIONAL charges to change the ice cream flavor on a sundae, until today. Very nickel and dime. I usually would not object to something like this, but they already charge very high premium prices, and it felt like buying a car with the upsell prices. When you buy one scoop of ice cream are the prices different for every scoop? If I want a scoop of Belgium Chocolate, the price should be less since the other flavors cost more to substitute, from the smores sundae, right??? First time I had ice cream and left with a bad taste in my mouth (actually in the end I left without ordering what I intended and went to Cold Stone). While the ice cream is good I'm not sure it is worth the attitude.",unknown,Positive,Negative,unknown,1
"Went to the grand opening today on Friday, 12/6/19. Headed there by 815am and there was a line about 50 people. Luckily it wasn't too cold that 45 minutes waiting did feel bad. I got the ticket for the free yard tea which I choose was jasmine tea. When 9am hit, the unlv cheerleaders did a small performance, ribbon cutting, and red good luck streamers came down. By 9am the line was all the way down to the bbq place. Line went quick to get in and it was pretty organized. The main items were there, however not full menu they had. Only gripe was it was crowded getting thru with the fresh bread getting refilled. Make sure you look at every item so you don't have to fight the crowd going back. Because I got the tea, I didn't get my usual boba definitely will going back. Now I don't have to drive to So Cal !",unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,4
"It was one of those nights when I wanted something sweet and cold, but I didn't want your average joe ice cream. I read about Sweet Republic in a local magazine and I couldn't believe a Cheese Course Duo ice cream was offered at the shop. It was a necessity for me to try it that night. I was the only one in the shop by the time I arrived, being close to quitting time but the woman behind the counter was extremely helpful. The first thing I wanted to sample was the Cheese Duo flavor. It consisted of Roquefort cheese and Medjool dates. It was intense, rich and very unexpected. It was delicious but I wanted something ""cooler"". Then, as I walked over to the sorbet area, the flavor, Mango Lassi, caught my eye right away. I knew at that moment, the Mango Lassi was my treat for the night. I was so sure of myself, that I didn't even sample it. Once I put the spoon in my mouth, my craving was fulfilled, and I was happy.

I was too busy looking at all the retro candy from my childhood, so when I got to the front of the line...I had no clue what I wanted and didn't want to hold the line up. So, one of the gals suggested the Peanut Butter ice cream (score!) and the pretzel cone I had already planned to try...because...it's a pretzel and a cone! I loved the creamy natural tasting peanut butter ice cream, but the cone was a bit of a let down. It was a tad too salty and not light and airy like a regular pretzel. It was thick and on the crunchy side. So, I think I'll skip it the next time I go in. We enjoyed sitting out back though! Make sure you make your way back there instead of sitting out front where the line is a bit in the way.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"This is definitely a different approach on classic ice cream shop. Instead of the classic ""baked bear"" ice cream sandwich or cold stone waffle cone, Fatty Daddy's delivers a melange if textures and tastes. Each component of my treat, had a different layer of creaminess! First, a cloud of roasted Smokey marshmallow that falls. Then comes a delicate silky macaroon. Lastly, a frosted hill of smooth ice cream. I asked the guy his favorite mix - Irish cream ice cream with a Carmel macaroon. We both got some and enjoyed everything!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,3
"I really like Milk Bar. I visited the Vegas location for the first time recently (previously I had only been in New York), and it's a cute little counter spot located in The Cosmopolitan. For those that don't know, Milk was created by Christina Tosi, who founded the dessert programs at the Momofuku restaurants. This makes Milk a huge draw for a lot of people (including me), so don't be surprised if you visit and it's packed. We lucked out and it was completely empty when we stopped by early on a weekday, so we had no wait and we were able to order quickly. On this visit I opted for a Cereal Milk Latte, as I had just had breakfast and didn't have room for much more, but Milk offers so much more! They're slinging some standard desserts including truffles, pie, milkshakes, cake, and cookies; BUT, they offer them up in flavors you're not going to find anywhere else. First, their Birthday Cake flavor is unlike any other. Why? I don't know. It just is. And it's delicious! Try the Birthday Cake or the B'Day Truffles. They also have Cereal Milk (like my latte) and the Milk Bar Pie (a.k.a. Crack Pie) is bomb! If you're in the mood to opt for a cookie, try The Compost Cookie, it's got a hodgepodge of mix-ins, and it's delicious! And this Vegas location has tons of alcoholic drink options as well. Milk is a bit pricey, and depending on when you visit there may be a line, but I honestly think the desserts are worth it. It's not fancy, so please don't expect that, but if you're looking for a delicious cake, cookie, or pie, then Milk Bar is your spot.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"Where has this ice cream been all my life?! Absolutely- delicious! The texture and flavor is unlike any other. I had a chocolate scoop paired up with a chocolate dipped waffle cone... because I obviously love chocolate, and it was chocolate heaven for my taste buds. Now let's talk about customer service. The BEST customer service received on my entire trip. We were greeted promptly at the door. We got free chocolate samples. Someone was ready at the register. I enjoyed the atmosphere so much, I decided to sit down and have my ice cream inside the establishment. Which was well kept and welcoming. #TeamGhirardelli",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"This might be my favorite Ice Cream shop in Arizona. And it get so much better as it's local! SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL COMPANIES! THIS IS MERICUH!! Actually to be honest I'll support any shop that has ice cream in it. Some information I guess since this is a review. -My favorite Ice Cream flavors by far are the Salted Butter Caramel and the Maple Pecan. But I've never had a bad flavor yet from them. And oh you better believe that I have tried them all. Possibly sampled every flavor every time I've went. -I love that it is open til 10pm. Seriously, who hasn't had the late night cravings for ice cream?? and Wow Thanks to Yelp I now know that it is open til 11pm on Fridays and Saturdays. This place gets better and better! If they would now only be open 24 hours then my dream of having premium ice cream at 3am can now be fulfilled. -They have Almond brittle -They have Bacon Brittle -Let me repeat that. They have BACON Brittle. This is by far the best bacon brittle that I've had. Makes me want to buy a package and sprinkle it all over everything. IF bacon makes everything taste better, how about bacon brittle?!? -Toffee Banofi. Just get it. I rate this place 5 stars. Woohoo! As good as it gets!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5

"Every time I'm in Vegas, I have to stop by and get a slice of birthday cake.

Based on prior experience and the price I paid, had higher expectations.",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,3

As soon as we walked in, we were warmly greeted by the friendly workers who were more than willing to answer my never ending questions.

"Short Review: Donut Bar originated in San Diego and places an emphasis on fresh, tasty, picture worthy, and creative donuts. If a caked donut full of sugar is your thing, then give Donut Bar a try. Donut Bar is considered one the best and their customer service is excellent. Just be early because these donuts sell out fast. Longer Review: I remember the excitement when Donut Bar opened in Las Vegas. I'm not going to lie. I wasn't that excited when I heard the news. I didn't bookmark this place and had the opinion that Donut Bar was just hype. I'm originally from the 619 and remember when the first Donut Bar opened their doors in Daygo. I was one of those people that waited in line. The owner of that location was pretty cool and would walk by the line with full sized donut samples to patrons waiting to get in. Originally, I wasn't a fan. I had a few failed visits because their donuts were either out or I got something that was too sweet. I always picked a donut that just didn't ""wow"" me. I am also not into a cake donut with a bunch of sugar on it. I'm really boring when it comes to my donuts. I prefer a chocolate glazed raised donut, maple bar, cruller, or an apple fritter. That's all I really need or want when I'm in a donut shop. But when the girlfriend loves donuts, then you support her by eating donuts. I have been here a couple of times since grand opening week. I've tried the Samoa, The French Toast, Cake Batter, Caramel Latte, the Big Poppa Tart, CrÃ¨me Brulee, Matcha Cake, PB&J, and of course, the Homer. Their originality, freshness, and consistency stands out. I haven't had anything here that was too oily and greasy. Again, these donuts really do not appeal to me and in my opinion, just too sweet. But then I had their Caramel Latte. This donut is perfectly glazed with their latte flavor. Then a little whipped cream and caramel is added. Because this donut is large, the glaze and toppings do not give it that overly sweet taste. The texture is also perfect and not dry at all. This donut with a cup of their hot coffee equals perfection. I will cheat on my chocolate raised donut any day for their Caramel Latte. This donut alone made me a fan. 2017 Yelp Review #77",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,4

"The macarons were pretty standard, and on the pricey side unless you get a 5 pack. Would give them 4 stars, but the first time we tried to go there, it was an absolute nightmare. We asked two Venetian employees where it was; one gave directions to the ""closest one"" and said there were three locations, the other said there was only one location and directed us to the one under the escalators by the Grand Lux. We arrived at that location 7 minutes before 9 (closing time) and the place was abandoned. We made it to the one facing the Strip about 3 minutes later just by chance and it was also closed. That location also opened late the next morning when we went back and I would have foregone the entire thing had I not wanted macarons so badly before my flight home. On the plus side, there was no line at all and I really liked the packaging of the 5-pack for the airplane.",unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,3
"Presti's is awesome! I live essentially right next door to the place and love to get cannolis and cafe au laits when I just want to relax and catch up with a friend. I don't get to see one of my friends much, but when I do, we ALWAYS go to Presti's. At times, we get overwhelmed with the crowd there, but we never fail to see cute babies and indulge in some fantastic desserts! The stromboli is amazing as well! The convenience is also incredibly appreciated, as there was once a wine filled evening when we all wanted some cookies.

"Now as a vegan, I wanted to write a new review to reflect my thoughts on Novel Ice Cream. I visited with some friends on Friday night. The space is really small and there were two people behind the counter serving samples, scooping scoops, and checking us out. With about 6-7 people ahead of us, It took about 15 minutes before we got to the ordering counter. We taste tested the two vegan flavors that they offered in the current moment - lychee and some sort of berry sorbet. The berry sorbet was VERY sweet, but the lychee was perfect! I shared a double scoop with my partner and added a single vegan topping. While the berry was overly sweet, the lychee was able to tone it down a bit. I believe they also offer a vegan sprinkle cookie and certain cereals as toppings! Maybe they'll make vegan doughnuts or offer more vegan flavors one day?? Know that there was plenty of street parking when we arrived. There was a scatter of people before our arrival. When we got our ice cream, there was a long line of about 15 people down the ramp! Timing is everything I suppose. Love the vegan offerings and will be back/recommend because of this!",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5

"I give the Confetti Cookie 4 stars - delicious! The Chocolate Chocolate cookie's flavor leaned a little too heavy on the dark chocolate side for my husband's liking (and for mine). I tried the Cereal Milk White Russian. I think it would be better without the cereal milk flavor. Husband had a chocolate cereal shake and found the cereal milk flavor to be too overpowering. I guess it's just not for us, but if you are someone who lurvvs cereal milk, then this place might be perfect for you!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,3

"Donuts & coffee, the forever couple. This place gets it right in a cute downtown location. I went early afternoon on a weekday and there was still a good selection of a variety of flavors. These are really aesthetic ""crowd-pleasing"" donuts, I tried three. They're lighter (yeast-raised) than fancy donuts elsewhere, not so much the ""i had two and I don't need to eat again today"" I've run into elsewhere. The prices are also surprisingly competitive. Discounts for a dozen, and there were some basic bar-shaped donuts for just a dollar when I was there. This place won't break the bank. There's curbside parking (metered), and a shared shady courtyard out back. Check it out.",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"I have never had ice cream that was soo good... we ordered a cookies and cream scoop and then a churro sandwich with vanilla a ice cream with some caramel drizzle! Oooooo! If you are not dog friendly I suggest another ice cream shop, (maybe Mitchell's down the street ?) We came and didn't really know until we were here and wondering why there were so many dogs! This cute little shop can get VERY crowded. The staff here is VERY friendly and willing to help with whatever you need. I will be coming back for more of the churro! So savory and just enough sugar. Thank you so much for the lovely experience! Also, a small note!

It is full of rum, they even soaked the raisins in it, it is very flavorful - perfect for the holidays. I bought two half gallons. All of their flavors are made with premium ingredients by one of the best!

"The Crack Pie Ice cream is TO DIE FOR!!!! Crack pie is also very delicious as well. I've been a longtime IG follower and was pumped to hear that there was a MILK in Vegas back in April. Had a local take me to the money and spent a shit ton of $ on desserts for the 5 hours drive back to California. Best cookies to order in my opinion are the compost and cornflake-chocolate-chip-marshmallow cookie. I honest feel like the cornflake is the best. If you have a craving for corn, grab the cornbread cookie. First time I had it, it hit the spot... Second time around it kind of tasted different. Hoping that that was just the heat and alcohol causing the difference. When ordering the soft serve, do yourself a got damn favor and get the crack pie with cornflakes... That shit is FIRE! OVERALL - love this damn spot & they need to come to SoCal!!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Very basic pastries. We were very excited to try The Cake Boss bakery but it was disappointing. As I wrote in the review about his restaurant, due to his popularity they very busy and cater to quantity rather than quality. I've been to better bakeries, don't waste your time in the long lines or your money. My SO tried a cupcake and had the cannoli cheesecake, they are gluten free so no crust, my favorite part. I will not return. Overrated:-(",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,2
"I feel like Milk Bar is the backup plan for people unwilling to wait in line for an hour for eggslut. I'm so glad we are those people. Milk bar has these little bagel pops that is just a bunch of cream cheese stuffed into a bagel roll. They also have drunky milk shakes and coffee (hair of the dog) that are surprisingly strong and can get a good morning buzz going. Don't judge, it's Vegas! We went back twice because they get people through the line quickly, and their drinks and treats are tasty.

"Disappointed is my word for this location. I have visited the Fort Lauderdale location twice and have walked away raving about the food. When I saw that Las Vegas had a shop, I was giddy!! We took our, who was a first timer, into the shop as well and told her about all the yummy options!! I didn't want too much so I ordered 2 scoops of Cookie Monster with hot fudge. The server seemed to not understand my order but finally got it straight. It wasn't bad. For $8.99, it should be amazing, right? My friend ordered a chocolate milkshake. Again, a different server seemed to be lost on what to do. In the times of today where lots of places are short on help, I wasn't surprised. She also asked for whipped cream, which is an added charge. This shake took 5 minutes to make. Not sure why. And her whipped cream wasn't on it. She said something about it didn't taste right. We couldn't figure out what. My husband ordered the cookies with ice cream. It's our most favorite thing. He was extremely disappointed. The cookies were really hard and didn't taste fresh. The store was busy but the employees seemed off. There wasn't a lot of communication and the whole visit was just not what we had hoped. It felt messy in there. I would return to the FL location again but not this one.",Negative,Negative,Negative,unknown,2

A vanilla cupcake because I'm obsessed with plain ones. A cream puff filled with decadent custard! Macaroons, a Nutella cookie, black & white cookies & chocolate covered strawberries!

"As I walked up to the window, the concrete floors were swept, and the stainless-steel countertops were, pun intended, stainless. The red, white, and blue color scheme occupied my line of sight. The pictures posted of the ice cream dropped my jaw to the ground and led a river to flow out of my mouth. The gorgeous atmosphere and savoring pictures give a warm welcome to anyone who approaches. However, the long line of desert hungry people awaiting to have their orders taken haunted me. I stood distraught at the idea of this long line starting at the window and ending at the handicap parking space. The waiting time just get up to the window was around eight minutes; this was a minor inconvenience that can later be redeemed if the ice cream is delicious. On my first visit, I was overwhelmed by the dozens of flavors mounted on the sign. I was taunted by each flavor. It felt like each flavor of ice cream was calling out to me to get a scoop. The multiple freezers you can see inside the store only make you wonder what flavor is hidden inside. Any concoction you can make up, they will probably have it. They had a variety of ice cream flavors such as Chocolate Malt with Caramel, Banana Nut Cake, Coffee Chocolate Chip, and Pistachio. Not only does Handel's serve ice cream, they serve sherbets, ices, fat-free ice cream with no sugar added, and low-fat yogurt (if you want a somewhat healthier option). The manifold of desert options given at Handel's flood your head as soon as you come face to face with the menu. The various ways you can get the ice cream served is also endless. You can get your ice cream served in four different types of cones, in a normal bowl, or even in a quart and pint. Your ice cream can also be made into different variations; they can be served as a banana split, a sundae, a hurricane, and as a popsicle. This variety, for both flavors of ice cream and ways the ice cream is served, really impressed me. Some ice cream shops I have visited just have a couple of tubs of ice cream and they have the option of it being served in a bowl or cone. The fact that Handel's has been able to branch out of being a traditional ice cream shop made me set it apart from any other ice cream shops. Once I got up to the window to order, I found the service to be mediocre, well at least from the person serving me. He greeted me and took my order, but what became prominent is that he did not want to be there, which is understandable. He did not receive me with a smile on his face and he forgot one thing I ordered. The waiting time to get the ice cream in your hands can also take a while as they have to walk away and scoop into a tub of frozen cream and sugar. I then got the ice cream in my hands. I got a tower of the Chocoholic Chunk and I tried Banana's Foster, Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, and Chocolate Peanut Butter Brownie from those I went with. My ice cream of choice was a chocolate party because the ice cream was very rich in chocolate and had chunks of chocolate all throughout. You had a chunk in each bite, and the best part was that the chocolate was not hard and chalky like the M&M's get in a Mcflurry. As I just got a lick of the three other flavors I can only have a minimal opinion. The Banana's Foster was a blast of banana with a hit of sweet caramel. The Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough had the same big lumps of chocolate and smooth indulgent balls of cookie dough all mixed in a rich vanilla ice cream. The Chocolate Peanut Butter Brownie had squares of chocolate rich brownies and scoops of actual peanut butter spread throughout the chocolate ice cream. The intensity of these flavors freezing our tongues made the wait worth it. If the ice cream is this indulging the prices must be outrageous as well. Each type of cone and bowl come with a price less than five dollars. Each of these cones come with a pile of three of more scoops making the price well worth it. The pints and a plate with four scoops of ice cream are also around five dollars. What I believe is a great deal at Handel's is the Two Buck Tuesday promotion they have every Tuesday. Any cone or bowl of ice cream will come down to two dollars each rather than four dollars. If you decide to go on a Tuesday, you better be ready for the long lines! The price point is perfect for a flavor packed scoop of ice cream.",Positive,Positive,Negative,unknown,5
"I completely forgot how awesome Batch was until a recent trip back to Madison. I was pleased that they finally relocated to the bigger storefront, which to me meant that they'd likely have more goodies to offer. I was not disappointed. I've had numerous great items in the past from Batch, from their baguettes to the popular monkey bread. One of my favorite pastries since I was a kid was the ""morning bun."" I was like a little kid in a candy store when I saw that Batch had one of their own on my recent stop. As what Corey D woul say, ""son of a batch!"" This big buttery ball of goodness topped with gooey caramel may have been one of the best morning buns I had ever eaten........believe me, I've eaten many. This one may actually rival Simma's in Milwaukee. This alone would warrant 10 stars, but damn Yelp only allows five!

Here's the down-low it took this owner 2 years, to find the perfect ice cream maker, and a year to perfect his doughnuts! So bottom line; the PERFECT doughnut is stuffed with perfect ice cream! Here's the scoop, there's 12 flavors of ice cream, handfuls of toppings, and cereal, if you choose, to top off your ice cream. I tried all flavors before deciding on what I think is the best combination in the world! Strawberry balsamic and a scoop of honey lavender! I kid you not, it's the best! My son got Cookie Monster stuffed in a warm doughnut, hubby got bourbon toffee with cinnamon crunch cereal stuffed in a warm delicious doughnut! This may sound over sweet, and stomach churning with sugar overload, on the contrary....it's not too sweet! It's perfected to be balanced, leaving you wanting more! It's magic, I don't understand it? The owner and staff were outstanding providing exceptional service, and products!! I'm bowing down, as I finish this review! See you tomorrow!",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
I can't say how totally disappointed I was in going to the Vegas location of Carlo's Bakery!! I don't gamble and I'm not into Blue a man Group so for me Vegas is visiting family and getting good grub. I love lobster tails and I'm not talking the fishy kind I'm talking the amazing east coast confection that is slightly crisp on the outside but soft and gooey and filled with a delicious custard.. unfortunately that's not what I got at Carlo's.!! I wished I'd have tasted one before I bought 7 of them to take home to friends.. well I couldn't wait so on the car ride home to AZ I dug in and wished I'd had a trash can to spit it back out.. it was awful hard beyond belief with hardly any filling and tasted so badly of old grease that I could only take that one bite.. I had my husband try another one hoping it was just the one and he couldn't take but one bite either.. the whole batch tasted like four day old leftovers yet we had only gotten them an hour before and we specifically got to the bakery early to get the freshest ones. Well I think we got the oldest ones they had.. not going to go back here maybe when we visit friends in Jersey we will try the original shop.. sorry Buddy this place was terrible!!,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,1
"Maybe i am not fancy enough, but it just tasted like a cupcake. It was funny to order from an ATM. I rank it low because it was expensive (4.50 each) and not all that special. they are also not big at all. For the price, i expected it to be a larger cupcake.",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,2
"The donuts here were tasty and very beautiful to look at; however, I think the price is not necessarily justified. It is a nice place to visit, but not for a return trip. As you can see the photos, the case is filled with some pretty cool donuts. The second photo is the Nutella donut, and while it was good it was not filled very full.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,3
"I absolutely love this place! It is such a tastefully decorated and cute cafe tucked towards the back of the Arboretum Shopping Center. They were the first place in Charlotte that I knew of that served Black Sesame Ice Cream! I remember making it as a suggestion at local ice cream shops but no shop ever took the idea. I'm also a huge fan of Matcha and I absolutely love their Matcha ice cream since it's not overly sweet. My latest addiction is their Ube Latte with Oak Milk. They have since added some pastry items to their menu and my favorite is the Matcha Cream Puffs. The store is really bright and clean. The staff is always friendly and so patient since I have a hard time making a decision sometimes. I love how you can order online as well. I sometimes buy their pints of ice cream to keep a stash at home since the store is a bit of a drive for me. Overall, can't wait to try more of their items!",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
First visit and we were definitely impressed. Excellent ice cream flavors and shakes! We will definitely be back soon.,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
Luis & Clarissa were super nice & helpful! Definitely the best experience I've had here yet!,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,5
"Second time visiting, had to get my Lobster Tail fix! Those suckers are addicting. The brownie was just okay and the regular cannoli was good, didn't care for the chocolate cannoli. It's best to go on Yelp to check out the pics, that way when it's your turn to order you pretty much know what you want. It's hard to see when you're in line because the people ahead of you are blocking the display case. It is pricey but hey it's the Cake Boss, lol.......and you are in Vegas. Enjoy!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Shaved ice, ice cream, boba, and Filipino desserts all under one roof? Don't mind if I do! Very clean and welcoming atmosphere, sweet and accommodating staff. Their calamansi boba is unbelievable. Please keep this on the menu forever and always! They've got another loyal customer in me!",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"My kiddo and I love this place, so many flavors to choose from, many have one or two mix-ins! It's a walk-up place, so you order outside at the window and then get handed your ice cream through the same window.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"Good crepes can be really hard to find, but these are amazing. Their savory options are some of the best I've had. You have to wait a bit sometimes, but that just shows how popular and fresh they are. There is one guy that works there (maybe owns it?) that is a little scary from unfriendliness, but it's a brief interaction that shouldn't stop anyone from eating here.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"So rude and was so unprofessional,my wife told him it was our first time can he suggest the most popular he was like no didn't give any samples so yeah, I understand the names being unique but no info on flavoring overall will not go back and was expensive",unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,1
"The best tiramisu and gelato in town. Light dinners range from 7-10 dollars. The paninis are fabulous and so are the Cavetelli and meatball. You enter and take a ticket. (If there are people blocking the doorway with deer in the headlight expression yell "" excuse me"" and then push your way in.) Very clean and laid back atmosphere. Prestis is mostly known as a bakery. Its an after dinner treat in Little Italy. Great sidewalk cafe seating as well as seating indoors. Silverware and cold water are self serve as are the sodas and other beverages. Great place to take a date after dinner. I prefer the Stracciatella ice cream but the spumoni is good too. The lunch specials are hit or miss and I've had one served ice cold. No I'm not kidding. Stick to dessert anx you'll be fine.",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"Line was about 25 people long. It went fast! They have a variety of pastries and desserts to choose from. We got a tiramisu where the mascarpone tasted great. Creamy and just the right amount of sweetness. Got another dessert with chocolate ball over a cookie - toddler approved. The coffee was good. They serve lavazza coffee, fyi for coffee connoisseurs.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"You know that random moment into an 8 hour round trip when it's 2 am and you need a bit of caffeine to wake you up but you refuse to drink McDonald's coffee? Typically you're bummed because no good coffee place is open. This isn't one of them. AmÃ©lie's is open 24/7, no matter what time they will always be a macaron (or some delicious pastry) and drink waiting for you there. The service is super fast as it is counter service with wonderful drinks like Rose tea or rose syrup in random drinks. They carry wonderful brands like Harney & Sons (which to me is great). They also have a mean chai and espresso. The service is super fast especially if you're like me and you're counting down the hours for when you'll come home. The art decor ;(sadly I have no pics), is very hobo chicish, old looking art such as Mona Lisa with hipster sunglasses, random shoes all over the place that remind me of the movie Marie Antoinette. The back has a tapestry or two and covered in art with tables and couches for you to study at 3 AM comfortably and quietly(they even have a quiet room)!!!! Leaving AmÃ©lie's was like leaving a new place you'd almost called home, but alas I had a real home to get to. If you're in the area check them out and try their macaroons, they're hugeeeeee and fresh!!!",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Pretty awesome. I've been going to this place since I was little, and it's been consistently good as far as I can remember. THE ONLY THING, is that I wish they had a cake batter flavor, it's my favorite and sometimes it's the only thing that brings me to Cold Stone. Other than that, I love Custard Cup. I usually get a cookie-dough snowstorm, cold-fudge sundae, butterscotch sundae, or strawberry custard, but you can never go wrong, seriously. I never feel like it's officially summer until this place is open!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
I get the pizza every time I visit. I love that there is always ample sauce so I can enjoy it room temperature rather than warmed up. It's so good I'll even grab a slice after eating at Mama Santa's.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Okay, so I may be reprimanded for this rating! I don't get how this is good 'custard'. If custard stands for froyo-ish ice cream then yes it's good. Good texture, stays cold, no overpowering flavour and just yhe right amounts of sugar. And the lemon one is the best flavour. But, IMHO, this is not custard.",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,3
Really cool spot. I tried the Campfire S'mores flavor - it was incredible! It even had a touch of smokey campfire flavor. Nuts! The building itself is a work of art and it's cool that you can watch them actually make the ice cream right then and there. Was worth the stop. And the line.,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Absolutely amazing. Flavor combos are unreal ... if you like classic cereals, you have to visit this place!!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Walking up to Jeni's I felt a sense of southern hospitality and charm. In the heart of South End, the location and ambiance is top notch. I was practically knocked over by the amazing smell as I entered the shop. Their homemade waffle cones are to die for! Literally the best I've had (and I love some waffle cones). They offer so many ice cream flavors. Some on the traditional side and some creative and unique. I love the gooey butter cake and the salted peanut with chocolate flecks. Regardless of your taste, there is something for everyone!!",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
Mitchell's is one of the best ice cream shops in the nation! Whenever I try new ice cream shops I am always craving Mitchell's. The variety is perfect and the specials are always great. Pistachio is a classic but honestly there are no bad flavors. Service is wonderful and although in the summer lines can be long it's worth the wait!,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Jeni's denied my 6 year old ice cream. No cash excepted, nice to know once you wait in line for 30 min. Even offered to let them keep the change out of a $20. It's real nice that Jeni's can't take care of those that take care of them. We have supported them 2 times a week since they opened, never again!",unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,1
"I was very happy this famous dessert place in New York opened in Vegas. But after trying the ice cream, I think this place is bit overrated. The milk soft serve with crunchy cereal add-on ended up costing me $7 something. I was like ??? at the moment because I couldn't believe I paid that much just for ice cream. The price might work for NYC but definitely not sustainable here. There's no line when I visited. The soft serve was good but I think the cereal was a bit too salty. I'm not sure if I will come back.",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,3
"If you're looking for a spot to bring your kids for a quick treat or if you and your friends want to reminisce about your child hood days, come here and grab a cereal shake",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"I tried to love it. I really did. So much so I tried it 4 times. Their cupcakes and cake slices are so dry. Each and every time. The frosting is so heavy! But this could be a personal preference. The frosting is very thick and taste like pure butter. Savory items are okay. Both items were bland and plain. Again, I tried to love it but I just can't. You can't go wrong with their croissants. Haven't tried their coffee. Three stars for friendly staff, great location, and super cute store. We need more of these please!",Positive,Negative,Positive,unknown,3
"My sister ordered a key lime cake for my birthday celebration. The person who helped us when we picked up the cake was so lovely and the location is a cute, kind of cottage core style place. The cake was denser tha I had anticipated and had a more shortbread or pound cake thickness. Lime curd was tasty. All around good cake but would prefer to try something else next time. Would give a 4.5 if I could.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"I could not get enough of this place! I've been to the original Milk in NYC, so I was hoping for a similar experience. I was not disappointed, the Vegas location tastes just like real thing! All the ice cream is made from cereal milk and it tastes A-MAZE-BALLS. With or without the cereal crunch toppings, this place won't let you down! Located inside the Cosmo, just up the escalator, it's in a great location next to many other food options. My only gripe is that it's a bit pricey, but so was the NYC locale.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
Graham central station best flavor hands down! We come here every couple weeks! The staff is super friendly and nice and the ice cream is always amazing!,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Great place for homemade ice cream. Location is on the Ohio city strip so if you don't want to eat your ice cream in store, there are places to walk to. The ice cream is tremendous, smooth in texture and tastes great. Being homemade ice cream, this location features the ""magic shop"" where all the ice cream is made while you wait!",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"The first time I came here years ago I absolutely loved this place, but my most recent visit was lacking. It's a fun spot with a really interesting atmosphere and a beautiful display case of pastries. We got a myriad of treats to try and my husband also got a latte. I really wanted to try one of their lattes but can't have caffeinated coffee, unfortunately for me they don't have decaf espresso so I didn't get to try one. My husband really enjoyed his though. I tried a bite of nearly everything and it was all so sweet. I eat baked goods a lot so I expect them to be sweet, but these were so sugary I just couldn't stomach much of it. They were all good but far from the best I've had. The tables were littered with crumbs and hadn't been cleaned, which is a little off putting. The service behind the counter was helpful and prompt. I would say it's worth checking out if you're visiting and wanting to do something unique.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,3
Frankly I don't know what people like about it. To me this gelato just doesn't taste very good and I give it 3 stars because I am in a good mood. It's not terrible just not the place I would frequent (come again),unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,3
"I mean it's hard to complain when it's ice cream.... Novel is a cute spot in a slightly hidden location. Although I do love the look and feel of the artsy/grungy sitting area -- very First Friday vibes. Novel is known for their ice cream between two warm donuts. I couldn't do something that sweet so I settled for a scoop of their lavender lemon. It was light and refreshing! I wish there were more flavors to choose from, I was slightly underwhelmed by their selection. But still a great late night spot in downtown.",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"The Crepe deserves 10 stars - it's as good as street crepes in Paris. It's the only one in North America which is. The service deserves minus 10. They're about as joyous as Thom Yorke Radiohead trapped in a Medieval Torture Device during a family bereavement. ""Crepes"" by Radiohead When you were here before The servers wouldn't look you in the eye They don't act like angels And they make you cry They ruffle your feathers They live in a gloomy world They think they're so special They're so f***ing special But they have crepes! And you're a weirdo! That's why you keep coming here! Even though they treat you wrong here I sang that out loud last time I was here. You should have seen the dirty Luxe I got. I'm giving them a 5 star rating despite them having the worst service - perhaps that I've ever experienced. And if you have a problem with that, I don't give a crepe. It's one of the worst customer service experiences of my life, but it's also the best crepe in North America, so I'm giving it a 5 when they deserve a huge 0 (a zero, not an O, no way) for the enormity of their attitude problems. What to get: Crepe with sugar and lemon. That's it. Nothing fancy. Trust me bae. What not to get: Angry when they treat you like a pile of horse sh**. These kind of Luxe might not be for Lorde, but they're absolutely for me. I'd say (and there is some decent competition in Philly and Indy among other places) that this is the best Crepe I've had in the USA. It's the most similar to France. Shame about the sh** service though. What a contradiction. We're talking about probably the best crepe and found in North America. I would know. I love this sh**. I go to France for this sh**. I know which alley in Paris the very best and most moist (moistmost) can be found in. I am the sh** when it comes to knowing sh** about which crepes are the sh**. Most Americans (I'm British, and we like talking sh**) grow up on sh** bland sh** crepes so they wouldn't know the sh**ting difference, would they? Like sh** they would. So these are the most authentic and traditional and true to the style of France. I think whoever started making these must have visited France a good number of times because this is almost the way they taste on the streets of Paris. Get it with nothing but sugar and lemon. That's the French way. In addition to being hairy and thin and making out a lot. With more than church tongue. On the other hand, we're talking about some of the worst service imaginable. I mean I've had so many bad service experiences here I don't even want to go into most of them. I can think of 5. I'll just tell you about one. Most recently I stood in line for about 10 minutes - about 5 minutes before closing - and they refused to give me a crepe. They weren't remotely nice or apologetic. I explained I was only in town from Buffalo once every 6 months, and that I'd just stood in line for 10 min, and there were still 5 mins to go. And they were passively aggressively complaining about people being in their line close to closing time and saying things like (loudly) such as ""I hope those people don't think they're actually going to get served"" and ""don't you just love when people feel entitled to get served after we're closed."" It wasn't just one or two comments. They were loudly giving sarcastic crap to their customers (particularly me) for a good few minutes, all the way not actually telling me directly, sorry, we're closed, come back tomorrow. They waited until the clock had ticked to closing time for that. Hmm, how convenient. I've written what, 5,000 reviews? Near enough. I don't think I've ever been served by people quite this rude. And consistently so. It's definitely in my 5 most offensive and ugly customer service experiences. So They get -5 stars for massive customer service problems and horrendous attitudes and treating their customers like sh**. On the other hand I'm basing my actual rating only on the taste of the wonderful Crepes so it gets 5 Stars although I do so with a heavy heart because they are absolutely awful to their customers particularly me but it's happened so often that it probably happens to others too and I bet they'd have way better ratings if they were even remotely nice or fair to the people paying for their products run on sentences ftw amirite. Anyway if you read this far, thanks for giving a crepe.",unknown,Positive,Negative,unknown,5
"I thought i was going to love this but didnt. the ice cream was just ok and the guy behind the counter called it gelato, this isnt gelato. i also got the marshmellow and macron cookie on top. I love weird but this just wasnt working and wasnt very good. the guy behind the counter wasnt very friendly also. wont be back",unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,2
They have the perfect amount of coco puffs and ice cream. I'm not normally a huge finisher of sweets . But I drank the whole milkshake !,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
My partner and I were interested in the non-dairy options they provided. I had the dark chocolate truffle & he had the caramel pecan sticky buns. Both extremely delicious I was super surprised. I'll definitely be back when I'm in town.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
OMG! I Love this ice cream but after going there this evening and noticed that none of the employees were wearing masks or using gloves I will not be subject to irresponsible practices. We all need to be safe and courtesy of each other's health. You should also know that it is mandated by the Governor that masks are also required of your customers or they don't get served. Whether you believe or not in this virus you do not have any right to disregard health directives. So disappointed.,Negative,unknown,Negative,unknown,1
"One of my favorite bakeries in Charlotte, the NoDa one is my favorite location because it has such character and charm. They're not famously known for their Salted Caramel Brownie for no reason--this is a must-order! They also have a great selection of interesting macaron flavors.",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"I was very excited to try this place but it was not like I expected it to be. Seeing the long line I thought it would taste great, but once I entered the location, the bakery items looked very average. I knew by its appearance that desserts would not be what the hype was about but I really wanted to give it a try telling myself that something has to be great with everyone sanding in line for a treat. I ordered the most popular thing on their shelf and let me tell you, it was most definitely not good at all. I ordered 2 lobster tails, 1 strawberry shortcake and 1 chocolate hazelnut cupcake - $27 later I am left unpleasantly dissatisfied. One plus was the very helpful clerk behind the counter.",unknown,Negative,Positive,unknown,2
"A must-visit in Madison. It's a large storefront with few seats and many savory and sweet pastries. Their croissants filled with gruyere are literally the best croissants in Wisconsin. Their cheese crusted garlic bread sticks are large, greasy, and I have dreams about them. My favorite thing to do on the run is to buy one of their large bread balls with meat or bean filling. It changes daily - sausage, mushroom, and cheese; chick peas, pesto, and cheese; bacon, white bean, and parmesan. All amazing, though you'll need two to be full. I haven't even gotten to the sweets yet but rest assured that they're also all fantastic.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
What a cute little cafe. Got the parfait with a Matcha swirl and it was delicious!! I wish I had more appetite to get drinks. Everything we got was perfect and so unique. This is exactly the type of place Charlotte needs.,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"1 star off: I stopped by this bakery around noon on a Thursday and there were no croissants left. Aren't croissants a staple of French bakeries? 1 star off: No apology... 1 star off: No indication of when they will have a new batch... Just that there were no more croissants. I looked at the display case and there were only a few macaron flavors left as well. I like the Bouchon Bakery in Napa a lot, so I wanted to try this location. I just wish this location is better stocked, especially with the items that make it unique. Otherwise, it is just like a Starbucks...",unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,2
"I'm visiting from California and needed something to help cool me off because it's so damn HOT out here! I decided to try out Novel Ice Cream because of the great reviews and I'm happy I tried it out! I had the mimosa sorbet and it was very refreshing on a very hot day. However, my favorite part was the customer service! Jalen was extremely nice, funny, and helpful. If I ever come back to the this hot ass desert again, I will Forsure come back to Novel Ice cream",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Shame on me for not reviewing this place sooner! The Macarons are amazing here, they're so good that they're indescribable. I can't do them justice but I'll try. First of all, they're big and in this case bigger IS better, they're light, perfectly chewy and deliciously creamy in the middle. No other Macaron can compare, I continue to try others in hopes that they might be as good but I'm always disappointed. My absolute favourite is Raspberry, I've tried Chocolate, Vanilla, Coffee, Caramel and I think at one point they had Lemon also. The Caramel straight up had real caramel in the middle, making it extra decadent. They are just the most wonderful treat possibly ever.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Girlfriends would boast about Bouchon so this was my first shot of trying one out. Well, at least the bakery part. There's apparently 3 locations within the Venetian Casino, I managed to find two out of three. This one I found was near one of the hotel entrances. The line builds up quickly, so if you've heard of Bouchon or can smell the pastry, get in line! And no cutting!!!! Tried their regular and chcolat croissant---they nailed it perfectly just like the ones in Paris. Vanilla and chocolate eclair: so damn yummy. Each bite explodes of flavor, I'll leave that to you to think about. What they dropped the ball on the bread pudding. Way too much raisins jammed into the overly dry pastry that you end up building a pile of raisins as you rip through pieces of the bread pudding. Mind you, we got out pastries at 9am. Another note that if you order any type of drinks here on top of the pastry, you pay for everything, get the pastries up front...but the procedure on how you get your drink is idiotic. That definitely needs to be improved because not noting what they just made or even a name to a particular drinks= many pissed off faces standing by a counter that only lets one person get to it to get a drink. One. at. a. time. Oh dear...",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,3
"This place is heaven! The perfect spot for a cup of tea and a slice of delicious cake. Perfect for a craving as they serve by the slice and they are always making fresh, new cakes. They also make excellent full sized cakes per whatever you want, truly amazing.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
Real simple here. My favorite! I love bringing my wife and kids here. My personal favorite is the root beer float.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
On my very first visit to this Carlos Bakery in Las Vegas inside The Grand Canal Shopes at The Palazzo/The Venetian. The wait to get in was really no wait at all because I came around the slow part of the day. I got a cannoli which I had always wanted to try. It was extremely delicious and fairly priced too. I also purchased A souvenir metal coffee mug. I love the food their and next time im in the area im going to come back for more for sure. If you want awesome desserts that's delicious in your stomach and good on the wallet come to Carlos Bakery the worlds greatest bakery.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
