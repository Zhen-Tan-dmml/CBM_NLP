"The ice cream looked great but smelled like the toilet! When I ate the ice cream, it slightly tasted like it too. The ice cream was okay.",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,2
Very good icecream and other things Especially great in the summer Worth the trip in a Smith's shopping center,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,3
My ham and cheese croissant and kids carrot cake cookie were very good. The Fiji water for 6+ bucks was stupid though. Easy to find if you can read.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"wasn't too impressed. staff was super friendly, patient, and helpful. line was HUGE and staff said it wasn't that bad, and gets way worse. wait to order was 20 minutes...and wait for food was about 10 minutes. they serve ice cream and cupcakes, or a combo of both. ice cream was hit and miss, we tried 5 different flavors and only really liked about 2. i like the capn' crunch flavor, sandwiched between two peanut butter/chocolate cookies. it was HUGE. couldn't finish it all. none of my party tried the cupcakes, but they looked good. would I go back? don't think so...but the Linq is pretty nice.",unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,3
"The restaurant and the bakery are a must stop for me when I'm in town. There was a conference at the Venetian and the bakery that's inside had a line through the casino. I remembered this location and quickly ducked out of the conference to stop by to grab a coffee and breakfast pastry. I was so glad because this location was basically empty when I stopped in. Food: You cannot go wrong with anything you order from their bakeries. I've tried a number of things from them and my favorites are the oh-oh, chocolate croissant, mini brownie and toffee candy. I usually order an iced vanilla latte for my coffee choice too; it's better than the coffee chains nearby. Staff: Everyone is usually friendly and efficient with your order. I never have to wait too long even if the line is long. Location: this one is tucked away outside of the Venetian. It's upstairs from the Walgreens. Because it's kind of tucked away the line never gets that long.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"Took a while to find, it's hidden and it would be helpful to have a little more sign other than on the door. The toasted marshmallow was heaven and the coconut macaron was even more delicious than the marshmallow! I tried the fudgesicle ice cream and it wasn't great but I can't wait to try more flavor a! We will totally be back for more!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"Finally made a trip out here!!!! The donuts looked amazing!!!! and of course very tasty and moist! Plus of it all was it wasn't too sweet like most donuts are! If you are looking for not overwhelming amounts of sugar this is place to visit! donuts ordered- maple bourbon Strawberry split strawberry cheesecake All were very tasty! Definitely coming back here and trying the others! Also if you are coffee lover, they do serve stumptown cold brew!!!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Stopped by on my trip to Vegas this past weekend. I went towards the end of the day so I'm not sure if all the options were there. I purchased 3 items, 1 that they are known for and random 2 flavors. Was not that great and didn't finish any of them. Thankfully I didn't have to wait in line.",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,1
"Every time I visit family in Charlotte, stopping by AmÃ©lie's is a must! The macaroons are delish! Pistachio was my fave, despite the fact that it kind of turned my teeth green. The crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e was amazing! The custard was so creamy & not overly sweet. My sister is addicted to the salted caramel brownies. I'm not a fan of it though. It's good but just a tad bit too sweet for me. The coffee is great, the employees are so friendly, the sweets are awesome, & they're open 24/7! Yes! 24/7! Can't get any better than that! I'll definitely be back!",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"I have waited for so long for this store to come to Vegas since the first time I went here it was all the way in New York and the line was super long. My favorites here are the compost cookie, cereal milk ice cream, and birthday cake truffle.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"If you want the best eclairs, cream puffs and Italian cookies then this is your spot. It is excellent!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"After driving by many times & seeing the long lines, we were very excited to see basically no long Sunday morning, well about noon over labor day weekend. We told the employee we'd never been before and she was super nice. She began pulling out mini little silver spoons and offering us samples. I ultimately went with the salted caramel & milkiest chocolate scoops. The texture was my favorite part, it's tough to describe. Very creamy and smooth. My fiance loved the gooey butter cake. For the two of us it was about $12. Pricey but a fun experience. We'll be back!",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"I never got the chance to try the original location in California so I am happy I did since we got to stay at the Cosmopolitan. Since COVID, the hours and days are different for when they are open but if they are when you come you should definitely come try out their menu items. I went with their famous MILK butter pie. Rich buttery and great for a snack. If you feel adventurous you can try out their crazy concoctions of ice cream but I wanted something simple.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"My friend said a general rule of thumb is that if something looks good here, it is. I tried A LOT of stuff and everything was really good. Workers are hit or miss. Some of them were knowledgeable, and others just don't care. I asked one worker what the flavors of the chocolate cups were. She said, ""I don't know"". I waited and then she started guessing on a few of them but trailed off. I pointed at one, and I said, ""The one with the almond. Is that almond?"" and she said, ""Yeah, I think so."" I think her name was Mac. I wish she had a nametag on that said, ""Don't ask me"". She could have also easily asked the guy next to her. I highly recommend the chocolate cups. My favorite was the passion fruit one. And the French macaroons (macarons)... sooo good. I prefer the cream ones and my favorite was pistachio. I didn't like the cinnamon-sugar one - too grainy. I wish I had bought a gazillion and stuffed them in my suitcase to bring back with me. Go here! You will not regret it. Just be careful, with this combo of deliciousness and semi-priceyness, you might go broke.",unknown,Positive,Negative,unknown,4
"Apparently people rave about this place, maybe I talked to the wrong people cause nothing I bought ($45 worth) was any good. Simply put I find Walmart offered better pastries than what I purchased. Sad, I had high hopes",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,2
"The 3 star rating is based purely on the coffee and lobster tail. I would definitely visit again and try more treats to see if there's something better. When I went in the late morning there were only a few people in the store so I was served quickly and there was a large variety of items available. I ended up choosing the original lobster tail, which I was told had Bailey's flavored cream inside. I also got a hot coffee, which was a lot cheaper than I expected! Employees were friendly and helpful when I asked about flavor options. The downside was that there really wasn't any seating, so my husband and I wandered around the shops until we found a bench. The lobster tail was really crisp. Like really crisp. Causing an explosion of powdered sugar on my shirt and pants. The pastry dough tasted a bit stale, but I don't have much lobster tail experience so maybe this is the intention? The cream was indeed Bailey's flavored and plentiful. Definitely a messy pastry to eat on a bench, so I'd keep that in mind!",unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,3
I enjoy the sprinkles in California so much. I had 2 come 2 Las Vegas 2 see if it met my expectations. My go to cupcake is the red velvet.... it never lets me down :),unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"My new favorite bakery/sweet treat place. Everything I have tried here has been amazing. The espresso is good too! A little pricy, but that's expected for the location and quality of the pastries.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Well, it must be good because there was a long line (over 20 people) inside this morning at 11am. I will try it another time when not so crowded. Update, I have not returned to this Amelie's, but really love the one on S. College Street and the one near Carmen Commons & 51 in South Charlotte. Great food & coffee.",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,3
A great bakery in the heart of Little Italy. It was the only place open semi-late (9pm) on a weeknight in the area where we could grab dessert. I ended up with the cappuccino brownie and it was fantastic. Some of the staples like cassata cake were already sold out but they had quite the selection of desserts still available. Staff was very friendly and made each customer feel like they were at home.,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Just as amazing as I remembered! They had gluten free birthday cake, it was delicious and the slices are huge so more than enough to share. It's located on the second floor in The Cosmopolitan, very easy to find walking in from the strip.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
This is my favorite I've cream place. Literally the best. They gave a number of great standard flavors and they keep coming up with new ones. The honey definitely makes the ice cream more delicious. Would highly recommend the banana split and the waffle cones. Amazing all around.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
Walked in and was greeted by the sweetest lady!! My boyfriend and I absolutely LOVE TARO so we had to try the Taro with Boba and the Taro Ice cream! Both Delicious!! We definitely will be back,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"5-Star - cereal milk soft serve 3-Star everything else. I ordered the gift box that came with: -cereal milk soft serve (cereal topping included) -slice of crack pie --on the sweet side. Was able to share this piece with 3 others, and even then I wished it came with a smaller piece. - 3 birthday cake truffles --wayyy too sweet. Skip this. -compost cookie--honestly could not understand the hype about this product. The whole thing came out to $23 or $24. Note I think if you bought each individually it would be about the same price... All in all, I am glad I tried all of the famous items on the menu, but I will come back for the soft serve only! Maybe I'll even be adventurous and try the crack pie soft serve next!",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,4
"Fresh ice cream, great service, served in a bright/open setting: that's the Mitchell's experience! This location, in Ohio City, is right in the middle of great restaurants and shopping, and it's the place we go to for dessert after spending a few hours dining and exploring the area. The store-front is located in front of their large processing facility, so you can see the actual fresh ingredients going into their product. Nothing to hide hear: you can literally stand along a glass wall and watch ice cream being made! While you're there, don't forget to get some to go home with -- they'll even sell you some dry ice to make sure it makes it home safely. Seriously, I cannot get enough of this place. You should go NOW!",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Yes, it is hyped up because of David Chang. No it is not the same as the Milk bar on the east coast in regards to sitting in and dining. It is as stated, a ""bar"" that serves quick desserts. Much like an expensive Starbucks, created by a 2 Star Michelin Chef... It is a very good option for dessert. Being local I've been back a few times during the day - no long lines and one Saturday night during CES and was 12 deep. Not a factor cause the staff was prepared and had the line moving pretty well. Each time that I have went, the staff was really helpful and if there was a lag in service, they apologized cause some of them were still learning how to make certain things. The Crack Pie - on point, just like the one I tried at the east coast Milk Bar. The crack pie in shake form - yeah 10 bucks but it is Vegas. Competition will cause the prices to lower a little and stabilize. (maybe) Really sweet and rich - so bring your sweet tooth or have something pretty savory beforehand. Cookies - had them all but my fav is the compost and Corn flake with choc. and marshmallow. The one I liked the least was the chocolate chocolate chip. That was a little too sweet for me but I'm sure there are people out there who like them. Birthday cake Truffle - Was ok to me but my cousin loves them. They don't have the steam buns... Yet, but I am hoping that will happen. Sad to see some of the reviews be really picky with a place that just opened up. Give it a second chance and see how they have evolved to work out their kinks. I know that some are looking for that ""experience"" - I get it. Then dine in at Momofuku for that. I'm glad that Momofuku and Milk Bar are here and I look forward to returning.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
By far my fav coffee shop that's open 247. Every time I'm in Charlotte I drink my body weight in their seasonal lattes and pig out in the pastries. 15/10,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Check your receipt!Check your receipt!Check your receipt! Different price when you check out! And cashier will add some products you didn't buy. If you don't check the receipt, you will unconsciously overcharge. I've been cheated twice by them with this trick. The first time I found it after I got home. The second time I found it after I checked out. It can be seen that they always using this trick.",unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,1
"We stopped by on a Friday night 40 minutes before their closing time, and the line was still pretty long! The menu is up on the wall so we had enough time to look it over and see what we wanted. The decor is super cute inside, and the lighting is perfect for some great pictures! They do have limited seating and they have a few tables outside as well. We were lucky to find us a little corner to sit down at, as everything else was already occupied. It was dirty though and had ice cream all over. We ended up ordering one Thai tea with boba and a vanilla cone with fruity pebbles and sprinkles. Our total was close to about $12.. Yikes, a little too high in my opinion.... The cashier was beyond friendly and he got us through quickly! We sat down and waited for our treats. The ice cream was pretty good and it was very creamy. We enjoyed the Thai tea (it was nothing special) and the boba was perfectly made. It was the right amount of chewyyyyyy! *It can get pretty expensive especially if there are a lot of ppl in your group. We don't have that big of a sweet tooth, so we ended up sharing our ice cream cone between three people. I can't imagine how much it would've been if we had all ordered one... Do come though cause it's pretty neat inside and a bunch of their other drinks look really cool and tasty! I will be back again to try those out.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"Amazing donuts for affordable prices. I went in around noon, and they had a special of buy 1 get 1 free OR buy a box for $10. I'm not a huge donut fan because bread + lots of sugar makes me feel sick so I only got 2! (They close until all the donuts are all sold) FOOD 5/5: -Creme Brulee ($2): This is what their famous for because INSIDER FOOD showcased this particular donut online and it became a hit! I LOVED it, I'm a fan of regular creme brulee, and they did an amazing job of filling the cream inside the donut & having a sweet/crunch on the top. -Old Fashion Glazed (Free): This was fantastic! If your not into all the sweetness and bread, I strongly recommend this donut. Simple but very good. SERVICE 5/5: -Right when you get in your greeted by smiles and whoever is working is more than happy to recommend what they're most famous for & what flavors you like!",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"A great little place to escape the chilly Illinois weather! I stopped in here for coffee with a friend one day, had never tried this spot but have heard good things (and really wanna check out The Literary as well!) I was just looking for a cup of warmth and maybe a couple of sweet treats. We went in and it was so cute and intimate, a little bar near the window, some tables in the corner to work at, and a nice comfy couch with a gorgeous coffee table in the middle of the space. The walls were lined with various jams, cocktail mixes, teas, and coffees you could buy to try. A great little area to peruse while waiting for your coffee and food. I ended up ordering the Salted Orange Mocha and my friend got a Plain Black Coffee, I paired my yummy mocha with a decadent ooey-gooey salted caramel brownie and a flakey buttery classic croissant. The brownie was so rich and the salted caramel balanced it out nicely so the chocolate wasn't too overpowering. The croissant was very buttery and had a nice crisp flakey outside. The inside was fluffy and had those beautiful croissant layers you look for. My mocha really shocked me, surprisingly I don't typically like chocolate and orange together but I do love trying new things. The orange in this is super soft and doesn't have quite the punch I thought it would, it dances over your tongue and gets enveloped by the mocha. It's a very subtle concoction and I would definitely order it again! Overall this was a great coffee spot and it wasn't too crowded when we went in the afternoon. I think it may be a little overlooked with all the coffee shops on campus and downtown Champaign, I definitely think Hopscotch needs more recognition especially with all their cool coffee creations. I can't wait to go back and see what else they have to offer! * * * Check out my Instagram thatfoodiewithglasses",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"Man don't miss out on these! The shop is located in the older downtown section of Las Vegas but we made a special trip to find them on recommendation of a friend who lives locally and were not disappointed! Some of the best donuts ever. Don't miss out on the poppa tart, which is a giant pop tart shaped donut decorated like a pop tart and then has an actual entire pop tart inside it when you bite in!! Also the candied bacon apple fritter is banging!! Creme BrÃ»lÃ©e, PBJ bar and blueberry myer lemon all amazing! If you are a donut fan this is a must stop place!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Yummy matcha latte and such a cute place inside. I will definitely be back, next to hangout for a bit in the cute decor",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"I have never paid $15.00 for one small scoop of Mango sorbet and one small scoop of Cotton Candy ice cream with a small teaspoon of almonds for my granddaughter. Nothing was special about this. I will never go back it was a total rip off. No GMO's okay, and I liked that idea of natural sugars, but come on $15.00 for the smallest scoop, unbelievable.",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,1
The flavors- wow. Such an original blend of flavors to choose from! And I'm the most annoying ice cream buyer ever by wanting to taste EVERYTHING before buying but the staff was perfectly welcoming to it! I asked for the trio of 3 half scoops but the staff was not stingy and were delighted to give me 3 HUGE scoops of ice cream for the price of the trio so nice! But just know it's A LOT of ice cream! Loved this place!!!!,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"This little gem was recommended to me by my cousin. When I was in NY, I missed it and was determined to find it while staying in Vegas. I tried the salted caramel macaron (pretty big), better nutter cookie sandwich (best thing ever for peanut butter lovers), chocolate croissant, and a regular croissant. Everything was ON POINT! So glad I was able to find this place, since it's a bit hidden. Must try while in Vegas. Located at The Venetian. They have several locations so hopefully you'll be able to find one of them. Happy Eats :)",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Great Dessert Place! Looking for something to satisfy your dessert craving? I recommend checking this place out! They have a variety of desserts here. They have a selection of different ice creams, my faves were the pistachio, the taro, and believe it or not, the unicorn poop, lol. The unicorn poop is purple vanilla ice cream with sprinkles. The Cookie Monster was good too, but it's very sweet. They also have boba, shaved ice drinks, floats and sobets. They have three non dairy ice cream flavors as well. What I got was the halo halo, a Filipino traditional dessert. They have a super special option that includes buko pandan. They top it with something crunchy which adds more texture to the halo halo. I enjoyed it! The way to eat a halo halo is to just go ahead and mix it all up. In Tagalog, halo halo, means mix mix, which is exactly the way to eat it. All the flavors become mixed together and it makes for a nice cold tasty treat!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"You ever take a bite of something so good, and for just a split second you're mad? Like you've wasted so much time on other things? Their oatmeal pie is incredible. It's without a doubt the best oatmeal cookie I've ever had and the cream filling is a perfect compliment. It's not too sweet. It's a hefty sandwich about the size of a hamburger with a price to match, but it's worth every penny. We bought some other treats that we haven't even touched but if they're even half as good as the oatmeal pie they'll be fantastic.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"*Dreamland fantasy retro ice cream experience* Step inside churn from the midtown Phoenix sunshine and absorb the lively friendly atmosphere taking any kid (or kid at heart) to a happy place!! Homemade ice cream, cookies, waffle cones, pretzel cones?!?!? I love thee!!!!! I'm all about the butter pecan right now but only while Vietnamese coffee and I take a break. Peanut butter and jelly was one of my favorite features!!! I don't even count churn as calories because of the inner joy I feel supporting this business and the bliss I feel while eating my ice cream.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"I was originally just going to get one donut because my pastry threshold is usually one but after stepping inside Donut Bar you quickly realize how hard it is to just buy one. That's why we have two hands right, to double fist in morning sugar rushes? I ended up getting their signature Creme Brulee and a Nutella bar with a Cold Brew. If the donuts didn't do me in, the coffee did because it rocked my Friday morning. It was all so good I bought a round back for my co-workers to share the wealth. TIP: This cute, cramped donut shop is literally always popping so make sure you strategically find parking beforehand!",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"I highly recommend this place, it has really good ice cream (I recommend the strawberry cheesecake ice cream). Customer service is great too.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"I wouldn't say I'm an ice cream connoisseur... but I also wouldn't say I'm not one. With that in mind, believe me when I say Churn is always a great choice for dessert. Their ice cream is delectable. The strawberry shortcake sundae is unbelievable. The cookies tho, that's where the money's at. The salted chocolate chip cookie is legitimately one of the best cookies I have ever consumed. Minus 1 star bc I wish the flavors were a little more fun and flirty, but you can't beat the classics so I get it.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
Best Ice cream in town! Great service and even better ice cream. Do yourself a favor and order the dough melt you won't regret it!,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"One of the iconic places on State, my roommate and I visit this place a lot when we stayed downtown. Even after moving to west Madison, we still go back pretty often when we are on State. You just can't say no to ice-cream, rich and creamy ice-cream. They have disclaimers that give you plenty of heads-up as to what is in store for you. Lots of milk, cream, dairy products, chocolates or whatever the flavor of the ice-cream is. My favorites are the zanzibar (three different types of chocolates, can it get better??), oreo espresso, and black raspberry. As it varies from person to person, the best way is still to try their generous samples and just see which one bought you over. Their menu also extends to sundaes, milkshakes, take-home pints etc, just in case you want to deviate a little from the usual cones or dishes.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
Delightful and delicious ice cream. I had a scoop of Madagascar vanilla and the toffee Carmel. Both were great. The owners are there serving the customers and talked about butter cream and sugar ratios. If I lived here I would come daily just to support these guys. Fabulous ice cream makes it a no brainer.,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"This is a must do stop if your in Cleveland or passing through. Homemade ice cream, coffee & smoothies. We all had ice cream including a campfire s'mores, chocolate peanut butter cup, cookies/cream & turtle sundae.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
Awesome ambience and one of the best places to have Thai ice cream and crepe! Couldn't try the crepe but it looked delicious for sure. Also planning on trying the takoyaki they serve here the next time I go!,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Talk about a Hidden Gem!!!!!! Took my family on a little Spur of the moment Adventure downtown to visit a restaurant. The restaurant was decent not unimpressed however not impressed. That is until we decided to visit the little shops behind it. Only a few were open however one that was open at the time made our trip completely worth it!!! Novel ice cream shop !!!!! It is tucked away in a little cottage that used to house POWs in Phoenix from World War II. So the history behind it is pretty cool however that's nothing compared to The Taste, the Quality and the Service you will get from this little ice cream shop!!!! All of their ice cream is made from scratch, by hand....and I don't mean in a big vat. I mean by hand a few quarts at a time. They let our entire family taste each one of the flavors before we decided on our favorites. They serve it in cones, cups or between a waffle however my recommendation is the way we had it which is stuffed in a donut believe it or not! The donut was fresh and warm and ice cream was amazingly cold inside. Talk about sinful. Lol And of course the ice cream was amazing however shadowed slightly by the two people own the place ! They are an amazing couple with an amazing product!! This shop is definitely a must-see !!! Like I said before absolutely worth the trip!",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,5

"Presti's Bakery is a must do in Little Italy. In the heart of Little Italy, it is the perfect stop for lunch, a few pastries, or a coffee on the way to work. They have a wide variety of Italian sweets, gelato, and food that hit the spots. The lines can be a bit long during rush hours (around lunch), but the lines move quickly and it is worth the wait. If you're craving a true Italian Bakery in Cleveland, Presti's is the place to go!",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
Totally fresh handmade ice cream. Many great flavors. Tuesdays are special. Good prices. I definitely recommend it for ice cream aficionados,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5

"I love watching Cake Boss and always wondered, are those pastries and cake actually good? I stopped by, and the line was pretty long but I waited because I really wanted to try it. When we got to the front, I realized the line wasn't too bad, it's the people. They were all really slow. I think they should change the way they take orders, to be more efficient. I got a regular cannoli, chocolate cannoli and a lobster tail. I'd say it's pretty expensive, but it is Vegas. I wonder if the other locations are the same price. I thought both cannolis were pretty good and had a nice crunch to them. The lobster tail was definitely my favorite. I really liked the cream inside and the crispy pastry layers! I'd suggest you get this if you were going to get one thing. Overall, If you're a fan of Cake Boss, then definately come and try the pastries. But I don't think I'd be back and wait in line for them.",unknown,Positive,Negative,unknown,3

"I am a fan...and because of that, I stop pretty frequently...I'd say more than 50% of the time that I motor north into the Great Shining Beacon on the side of McDowell Mt. and Pinnacle Peak called ""North Scottsdale"", I stop off for cup or a cone! The ice cream is made with love and craftsmanship that surpasses that of most of the restaurants in the Greater Phoenix area...I really do love their Madagascar Vanilla Bean ice cream! Wonderful, delightful sweet treats...just about the best ice cream that I've ever had (and that includes the homemade frozen custard that I used to make...and I will tell you that nobody appreciates my own cooking more than I do!). So, Donald, why only 4 stars for the Republic? Is it just me? Am I xenophobic?...have something against ice cream based governmental systems?...maybe a lactose intolerance based grudge against the Republic and those for which it stands? No...no...I just want a smile out of somebody when I buy a cup or a cone and then maybe spend another $20-30 to take a little frozen delight home to the Beautiful Carin...I've been in this place 20 times or more and I never get more than a ""next"" out of the people dishing out the scoops! Or a hurried ""will that be all?"" when they are ready for me to be done and pay and get going... I try to chat...even stuff like ""how's your day?"" and ""boy, that looks great!"" is met with silence. Maybe it's just me... Last week, I dropped by on my way home from a visit with one of my attorneys (and you can believe me when I say I really needed a treat). It wasn't a busy afternoon...but again...I was greeted with...indifference. There was a sign in the window advertising for help...wanting people ""passionate"" about being there...OK, I see the passion in the ice cream...and the customer service isn't bad...not really...they always get to me eventually and I get what I want...but I couldn't say that anyone behind the counter has ever smiled at me...chatted with me...even when taking my money...sometimes quite a bit of money...it's a little bit disconcerting... Oh well, the ice cream here is the star of the show and I do like the ice cream! Oh, and a smile and chat would be nice, too!",unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,4
"Went to grab dessert at night and figured why not try the gourmet chocolatier shop here as it's close to the Linq, where we were staying. Unfortunately, their machine broke or something which meant my cravings for a shake were crushed. Didn't think I came to a McDonalds, but alright. Four stars for a slightly above average experience despite not being able to snag a shake. More like a 3.5 probably. Line was extremely long but the staff were great. Location is amazing as it's in the heart of the strip and on the promenade. Prices and value suck but you come for the experience at least once. Anyways, the ice cream scoops are generous and I regretted opting for a triple scoop. I contemplated throwing away my bowl because it was so much but as an ice cream fanatic, I couldn't bring myself to do that. Friend got a scoop in the sugar cone and the cone was challenging to hold because the scoop was ginormous. Another friend opted for the Drinking Chocolate. Well, it's literally melted chocolate, extremely dense with chocolate. It was a debate between that or the hot chocolate and he noted he would get the standard hot chocolate in the future.

Got four donuts and were even given some freebies to try since it was the first time visiting and hearing of the place. All were yummy and unique. Atmosphere was perfectly donut themed and employees were great!,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Good donuts, damn good donuts. What else is there to know? Ah... if you insist... So I guess this place is famous. I didn't know, I just came downtown to pay a ticket and saw a neat little sign for a donut shop. Inside I go and I'm just blown away by the different types of donuts on display! Homer's donut? Matcha donut? Nutella donut? What!? Which should I try? The answer is ALL OF THEM! Haha okay not really, but I did buy a dozen. The french toast donut was my favorite. I believe they make it on request because mine came out hot, and I did have to wait additional time for it. It comes with syrup on the side as well. My only regret is not buying two! It was that good. I loved Homer's donut as well. I believe that was strawberry flavored icing on top? It was simple, but great. The strawberry split was SO good! My partner loved how it wasn't too sweet, and loved having creme and strawberries in the donut. I didn't order the creme brulee donut this time, but I hear it's their signature donut. Heck, they all look and taste like signature donuts! Instead of cooking breakfast I think I'll just order a french toast donut from here instead. It was bigger than all the donuts and very filling. They close when they're out of donuts and trust me, they will run out. I recommend arriving early as there's usually no line. Definitely a must try when you're in Las Vegas! PROTIP: Their menu changes DAILY! You can also order in advance on their website only during THE DAY BEFORE! And it has to be a dozen donuts, minimum. I believe the deadline is 6pm, but I could be mistaken. This saves a lot of time during busy weeks if there's a festival going on in the city.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Their macarons are HUGE and possibly the best in Vegas. Yup, just in Vegas. Laduree will always be the best in the whole world.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,3
"Had the worst experience here on a Monday afternoon. My two friends and I walk in and we were the ONLY people by the registers/dessert bar waiting to order desserts. The kid who with the brown hair and glasses that worked there kept calling out numbers (apparently you're suppose to grab a ticket when you walk in which Happens to be on the side where people exit) and they serve you according to your ticket number (because we live in the god damn 50's) My friends and I stood there for about 10 minutes when we finally ask if we can order desserts. The kid working there then scolds us about how we can only be served if we grab a ticket. I then replied that we will grab a ticket and the employee says ""I will serve you this time BUT NEXT TIME... Grab a ticket"" well guess what asshole, there won't be a next time. How about you serve your guests who are clearly not familiar with your stupid ticket service and kindly explain to them how your system works rather than making them feel like a moron. As our horrible experience continues, my friend orders about 4-5 delicious looking desserts. The employee then decides to make the rudest comment to her ""you know that saying... Don't go grocery shopping if you're hungry"" no sir, we do not know that saying, please elaborate where your are going with this statement. Sorry for ordering desserts and supplying you with a paycheck, maybe next time we will order one single cookie so you can make 2.34$ an hour. As my friend was being ""served"" by this four eyed ass hat I was patiently waiting to be served also. I look over at the other employee who continues to flip his ticket numbers and shouting out numbers. We were still the only people at the dessert bar.... seriously?! Clearly this employee was also a moron. Finally the first employee finishes helping my friend and I ask him what his favorite dessert is. He replies ""Well I don't eat junk food"" .......... ....... ............... Is this a fucking joke? You work in the restaurant industry clearly at a place that serves desserts and your response is that you don't eat junk food? Are you calling your employers delicious desserts ""junk""? Nice I did not know how to respond to this peasants comment, so I continued to order what I thought looked good. I then ask him how they serve the biscotti cookies and he replies ""we sell them by the pound"" I then asked if I could get a half pound of biscotti cookies and he looks at me and asks "".......well how many do you want"" I then said ""I want a half pound"" and he says ""yeah but how many do you want?"" I thought to myself ""Are you fucking with me child?"" I will take four cookies- I responded. They had two different cookies and I asked if the sign referred to the bottom ones ( the sign said cinnamon) and the worker responds ""um yeah... S is for cinnamon"" um, okay. Finally he rang me out and I tipped him. I'm not sure why honestly. Probably because he was towering over me as I was signing my receipt. I would have rather donated my money to starving homeless people in Cleveland. Worst customer service I have EVER experienced and we will never go back. Very sad considering the desserts were amazing.",unknown,Positive,Negative,unknown,1
Love this little hidden nook! Such a great place to hang out and spend quality time with friends!,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,5
"This place was worth dusting off my keyboard for a yelp review. Precious describes the service, and Precious is the name of the woman who helped us. She was really cool and accommodating to me and more so to my kid, which is the way to my heart. My son apparently loves the place, and Precious wanted to help him out, decide what he should buy (he bought a bunch of cookies to bring back to his friends.) She was very down to Earth about it, and I appreciated it. She also seemed to enjoy her job and seemed like she actually liked the product she was selling. Shout out to the other two people there, all together, running a good thing. The 5 stars are because, with all that said above, the Milk Bar is also cool idea. Breakfast cereal and whole milk, turned into cookies and ice cream. I think it builds on that theme. And, the milk shakes we got were really good(we haven't tried the cookies yet.) My kid got the peppermint bark, and I got the cereal and milk with fruity pebbles. Beyond that, the location in the Cosmopolitan is awesome. I dug the hotel and the vibe and you gotta walk through the place to get to the Milk Bar. The only thing I'll say about prices, you're not just paying for quality, you're paying for the novelty and uniqueness of what they're selling. They basically have stuff that's really good, that you can't really get anywhere else. Overall, it's a great place, good people, amazing desserts, and it's fun to get there, ie, walk through the swanky Cosmopolitan.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"We heard a lot about Amelie's French Bakery and we decided to try out the bakery after the dinner. The cafe decor and ambience was amazing. We loved the decor and the cafe was nicely decorated. The cafe has different sweet options and there are lot of sweet options. From the options we decided to have Napolean, Creme Brulee, Mini Mousse Cup, Coconut Macaroon and Key Lime Mini Tart. All the sweets we ordered were delicious and finger licking. Do try this cafe as they have amazing sweet options.",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
Best bakery in Charlotte! Everything is 10/10 and the space is so unique and welcoming. Staff is excellent and helpful in decision making. Especially since they have a ton to offer.,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
I'm only giving this place one star because I didn't get to eat here. Why? Because they do a piss poor job in guiding you to this bitch. On the casino floor they advertise it everywhere. Then you start looking for it and there are no signs anywhere!! I had to ask 4 people that just told me to keep going. It's in BFE. Next to Rockhouse where you can't go any further. Now my family has lost interest. Put up signs to guide people here!!!! I'm sweating from the long walk here!!!! Damn!!!!,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,1

"Okay, so the first time I've ever heard of Sprinkles is when it opened in Las Vegas. I know, I know, I'm ""deprived"" or whatever you'd like to call it. Anyways, I went to the Linq with two of my friends with the intention of trying Sprinkles for the first time! Whenever I go to a popular cupcake place, if they have red velvet ... then that will be the flavor I'll be trying. It also helps that people rave about it. First off, they kind of have a ""schedule"" of flavors for the cupcakes. Certain flavors of cupcakes are only available certain days of the week. There are a few, however, that are available all the time, which includes their red velvet and vanilla I believe. So if there's a certain flavor you want to try, make sure to check their schedule! Each cupcake is $3.75, which seems normal (kind of....) for one of these popular cupcakeries. What's great is that they even have a mini cupcake treat available for you to buy for your dog for $2.50. My friend actually bought one for her doggie :) Awwww. Also love the fact that the plate they give you and the fork/knife are all wooden! It's cute and eco-friendly! When I first took a bite of the red velvet, I'll admit ... it wasn't heaven. BUT it was really good. The cake was really moist and flavorful. The frosting was really sweet and heavy, but that is what you expect from a cream cheese frosting. Sprinkles is probably one of the few places that could make a red velvet cupcake correctly. I've tried a lot of different ones and not all are as moist as Sprinkles so yay! Now I'm a little interested in how their Strawberry cupcake tastes like. I had considered getting one but ... I wasn't sure if I could finish it or if my friends wanted to help me finish it boooo They also have a ""Cupcake ATM"" outside. From what I heard, it's supposed to be 24 hours? You can order their cupcakes and/or cookies from it. However, the prices of the cupcakes, from what I noticed, is about 50 cents more expensive. I guess because it's 24 hours? Or the novelty of it? If it weren't for the fact that it's on the strip, I would go to Sprinkles more often. Alas, for me, it's not worth the trouble.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"Happy Birthday Donut Bar- 3 years old today!!!!! Such an accomplishment, and continuing to rock and sell out all the time. They have made the top 10 donut establishments across the country. When we arrived there was a line of patrons waiting and wanting to try these amazing delectable delights. There are so many to choose from. From Unicorn to Peanut butter and Jelly. Each is made fresh and they are differently priced. Upon entering off of 6th and Carson entrance, you walk up and are quickly greeted by wonderful counter people. They have so many options and are willing to take their time with you. They have espresso and coffee options as well. There is a small counter you can sit at, however seating is very limited. I obviously got several to say the least. The owner is very personable as I got the chance to meet him today. Pricing is a reflection of quality and presentation. Would def recommend. Once everything sells out, they close- come early Location is 6th/ Carson - parking is street or lots",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
I love ice cream no matter what but this place was amazing to me because of the people behind the counter. So fun! So cute! So nice! The guy was really excited to torch the marshmallow fluff i ordered and it was perfect. Ice cream was amazing as expected. I got a double scoop because my eyes are bigger than my stomach and it was too much. Peanut butter tastes like a cookie as opposed to from out the jar. Tiramisu has the right hint of amaretto. Oh I also grabbed one of those salted caramel things in the front. I assume it's house made but wow it's so buttery salty and 50 cents! Hehe get one on the go. So worth it if you're a caramel lover like me. Can't wait to go back. It's a really hip and crowded place.,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5

"Red Velvet Cupcake - it's been years, but I remember being quite impressed considering it's not one of my favorite flavors in general. Pumpkin Cupcake - The cake was light, not too moist, not too dry and it was perfectly spiced. The cream cheese icing was delicious. Only complaint - not enough icing. They should put some inside! Captain Crunch Ice Cream - It has a light cereal flavor and great texture due to the bits of cereal mixed in! I will definitely be coming back for this one!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"I would legit drive to Vegas just to get a Cereal Milk Milkshake! (Luckily one just opened in LA, so I don't have to - but still!!) I pretty much got everything cereal milk because its SO GOOD.

Pretty delicious. Cereal milk flavored ice cream wasn't super sweet which was a nice change and the cereal was a bit salty. Nice combo. It was a bit expensive but IT IS VEGAS AFTER ALL!,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,3
"I loved the concept of Sweet Republic- everything homemade to include the ice cream, the marshmallow, the waffle cones, the everything. Unfortunately, I wasn't overly impressed with the ice cream. I got the Belgium chocolate and it wasn't as rich and the waffle cone not as crunchy as I was expecting and wanting. Instead it sort of crumbled in my mouth. The thing I did really love about this place was the portion. I asked for two scoops and quickly realized they give two full scoops, not two half scoops like most ice cream parlors do.",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,3

"We had just had dinner and were craving something sweet; we saw their sign and decided to stop in. We were greeted with smiling faces and we felt so welcomed! We tried a few flavors. I decided on the Vernonni(sp?) it was a coffee flavor - delicious! My boyfriend had the Unicorn Poop he loved it and made the comment ""if someone never had ice cream before, I would have them try this flavor."" All of their ice cream is made locally here in Phoenix and their flavors are so creamy and delicious. If you're in the area, definitely stop in (especially if you have a sweet tooth)! Next time I'm trying the halo halo! We'll be back!",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"I visited this establishment a year ago in search of Shaved Ice...imagine my surprise when i visited here this past Friday for my weekly night out for Ice Cream with my wife...that this same establishment has some of the best ice cream i have ever had. I am not going to tell you anything more wonderful than you have already read from other yelpers but i will tell you what i had. I had the toffee boneffi sundae which consisted of Madagascar Vanilla ice cream, a whole chopped fresh banana, almond toffee crunch, drizzled with a salty Carmel sauce. Sounds great right? Trust me it was...and i don't even care for vanilla ice cream...but it may be the best i have ever had. They make the ice cream by hand and it is an all natural Artisian ice cream made from all natural and local ingredients. They have board games to play and free Wi-fi as well...i mean how can you beat that. Now the ice cream is a little pricey...and they have some wild combinations for flavors but i will definitely be returning very soon to try some of the other flavors of ice cream. So if your ever in need for a very good treat find a sweet republic and Eat, Drink, and enjoy the sweets my friends!!!!",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
I went here with my family to get some desserts for my birthday. Their selection is amazing and everything we got was fantastic. I especially loved the strawberry eclair I got and the cheesecake I tried was amazing to. My sister enjoyed her cookies and my parents liked the cakes they tried as well.

My favorite French bakery! I always stop by for a breakfast sandwich on croissant and grab a latte or espresso. Can't beat their coffee prices! Other coffee shops in the area overcharge for their watered down coffee and I think Amelie's does the opposite. I love seeing what pastries are in stock and it's always a treat to splurge on one (or four). Def recommend for a local cafe and bakery.,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"I was there for the first time on Sunday. I ordered a loaf of bread, turkey cheese sandwich and a lavendar lemonade to go. I never was told where to go get my drink, so I sat there with my number sign and waited, and waited and saw people who came in after me served promptly. So I wondered over to what looked like the place to get drinks and asked if a Lemonade was made long ago. I was told no, so I thought can I get one as I have been waiting now well into 20 min. I asked the gal who made sure to make at least five drinks for people who came in after me and get around slowly to making my drink. So, happy to sip the drink I waited, and waited for someone to collect my number (which was 1) and saw others get their food promply and I was never approached by a staff member to be asked what I ordered. After 30 min or so I flagged down someone and asked where and when I might get my food. Well, they had no idea what my order was and after roughly 45 minuted I got my order after pleading with a staff member. They threw in a cup of soup for the mix up but I have been a server in the past and felt that the cashier dropped the ball somehow as she saw how long I waited and never acknowledged me after I paid. It was early afternoon and slightly busy, but still they need more people making drinks and calling drinks loudly to the crowd waiting so they know what's going on and give instruction to people at point of check out where to go get beverage. I'l come back as I like the place very much. But bad impression for the first time I entered this well spoken of place.",unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,4
I used to swear by this place. Everything was amazing. Lately however I am so disappointed on how its been going down hill. So many peoples favorite is the salted caramels and they are always out of them. And many other popular items seem to always be out as well. The owner must not understand supply and demand. Also they only ever have one person working making it unorganized and slow. The product is good but about everything else is not.,unknown,Positive,Negative,unknown,1
"The owners take so much pride in what they do and they were so welcoming! They encouraged us to try all of the flavors, and I tried quite a few. I shared a donut with chocolate and Oreo topping with my friend, and had a separate scoop of coconut lime sorbet. Both were awesome! We were there at 6:30 on a Friday, before there were lines. There's no inside seating, so dress appropriately. I highly recommend!",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5

I've never had a slice of cake more moist and delicious in my life. Already craving another slice and extremely sad that it's not in arms reach.

"Let's just get this out of the way: is it safe to walk in and order at the counter? YES. Everyone is masked and they enforce social distancing. Now, the good stuff! Hands down the best Italian bakery in NE Ohio, and honestly, probably all of Ohio! I've been coming here since my teenage years and this place has gone from a Naples, Italy-style (I know, because I was just there last year) small storefront bakery to a brick and mortar cafe and bakery with dine-in options on the same street, on the same block! Why? Because they bake consistently delicious pastries that keeps customers coming back with lines outside the door. You want cassata cake? No problem. How about 5 different flavored cannolis? Sure thing. Tiramisu? Of course! Cheesecake? Italian or NY style? They have both! Sfogliatelle? Hells yes! Macarons and macaroons? Both, in about 20 different flavors, plus many, many more delectable traditional Italian and New World pastries. Can I get a side of cavatelli to go with my dessert? Defnitely! It's made from scratch. So are the meatballs, sausage, peppers, and marinara sauce! Mama Mia!",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5

I ended up getting one that had caramel, peanut butter, pretzels and something else in it (can't remember the name but ""skippy"" was somewhere in there). My husband got the French toast (good but I'm not a big maple syrup fan - at least not in ice cream). He also got an award winning salted caramel ice cream that was PERFECTION.

"Christina Tosi is my favorite baker. The treats and desserts you get at Milk Bar are unlike anything you have ever had before. The success of Milk Bar can be summed up by saying it's the perfect combination of science and creativity. Cookies (4-5 stars) All are at least 4 stars but the sure winners are the Cornflake Chocolate Chip Marshmallow Cookie (which tastes like Frosted Flakes had a baby with a chocolate chip cookie) and the Compost Cookie (which incorporates salty treats to the sweet cookie to create a flavor explosion). Crack Pie (4.5 stars) - Don't think of this as pie. If you compare it to traditional pie, you may find it odd. Think of it more as if a butter cookie was fused with pie crust. It's unlike any dessert on the planet. It's equally as buttery as it is sweet and very satisfying. Cereal Milk Milkshake (3 stars) - The first few sips are incredible. It really does taste like cereal milk blended with ice cream. BUT it's incredibly sweet. So sweet that my husband and I couldn't even finish TOGETHER their smallest sized shake. If you can handle a ton of sugar, go for it! But if you're a weakling like me... maybe pass or just be OK with throwing some away. Birthday Cake (4.5 stars) - It's visually stunning! The cake is very spongy and light. And there are funfetti cookie dough crumbles throughout. This would be the world's perfect cake if it wasn't for... CHOCOLATE Birthday Cake (5 stars) - I normally don't like chocolate cake that much. I almost always prefer vanilla. But this one, WOW! The cake tastes like an Oreo Cookie in cake form. And the frosting tastes very similar to Oreo Cream. Also... We bought this cake and I totally forgot about it (because I normally don't want Chocolate cake). I ate it a whole WEEK after we bought it and the cake was still soft, spongy, and fresh as if it was just made that day.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Overall, this is an amazing bakery in a must visit part of Cleveland. The lines can get long at times, and I have waited as long as 30 minutes before, but the food is worth it.

If you're in the Little Italy area definitely go visit.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"Bouchon Bakery is one of those ""pilgrimage"" bakeries that you must visit at least once a year (or once a month if you're an LV native for all I'm concerned). Their macarons are crazy delicious and are really large like the rest of the pastries there. I would personally recommend getting (in addition to a box of macarons) the chocolate croissant, the chocolate bouchons, and the TKO (Thomas Keller Oreo).",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Update: Ghirardelli contacted me regarding our experience and apologized for how we were treated. Since they have shown their determination to customer satisfaction I wanted to change my rating to 4 stars. I hope that with the changes made people will be treated with respect. TERRIBLE SERVICE! I walked in ready to buy a bunch of chocolates. I had my mask on but my husband had a drink so he wasnt wearing one. The guy behind the counter very rudely told my husband to put his mask on. When my husband turned around to show him he was drinking, the guy told him to either put his mask on his ear or to leave the store, meanwhile there were 5 other people eating and drinking that he did not tell this to. We have no problem wearing masks but this was ridiculous and no one should be treated like this, especially loyal customers. We walked out and will not be back here.",Negative,unknown,Negative,unknown,4
"On a mission to try the macarons, we stopped by in the morning. These were the choices: Raspberry, Lemon, Vanilla, Espresso, and Chocolate Mint (which just sounds wrong, and not really French). I was hoping they had a Salt Caramel one like at Laduree in Paris, but sadly, they did not. Had the Vanilla and Espresso; both were good but the Vanilla really owned! Also had a cup of coffee, which was quite bold and flavorful. For the two macarons and a small coffee, it was like 13 bucks==excessive! It was tasty though...",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,3

"In looking for another ice cream place in Las Vegas, we ended up here. Intrigued by the business name, we approached and saw that they serve soft serve. One of the soft serve flavours is ""Cereal Milk"". I asked the server what it tasted like and he said, ""It's really hard to describe the taste, other than cereal milk."" So I replied, ""So....vanilla?"" And he said ""No, not vanilla. Let me give you a sample."" So he gave me a sample and the rest is history. It tasted like cereal milk! I said to the server, ""OMG this tastes like cereal milk"", and he laughed and said ""I know, hard to describe otherwise!"" Now I'm not usually an ice cream eater but I had to order myself a cup of this cereal milk soft serve, which blew my mind every time I tasted it. They had other flavours too, but honestly I couldn't tell you what they were - I didn't pay attention because I was so blown away by the cereal milk flavour. I did notice that they sell the flavour mixture so you can create your own cereal milk ice cream at home. So, it's no secret that the flavour is achieved by adding corn cereal powder to ice cream, among other things I'm sure. Next time I'm in Las Vegas, with kids or otherwise, I'm totally hitting this place up again!",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Absolutely obsessed with this new bakery! Their macarons are incredible and brownies are to die for! The staff was so friendly when I walked in and the building cute as can be! I've driven by it every day for a while and have been meaning to pop in, SO glad that I did! It's such a gem, highly recommend trying their maple bacon macarons. They're seriously amazing!! I will absolutely be back, sooner rather than later! Thank you for making this such an enjoyable first experience!! 10/10 Would Recommend!!",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5

"Have always wanted to try the Momofuku milk bar in New York and never got the chance, so I was super excited to find this place in LV. Turned out to be my biggest disappointment in an ice cream, EVER. I got the signature cereal milk soft serve. The ice cream itself lacked richness and taste, felt like a weird middle ground between ice cream and sorbet. The cornflakes were not ordinary cornflakes. They were not flakes first of all; they were crushed and stuck together. They were not as crunchy; it felt like they have been left out for a while. Worst of all, they were SALTY. Who had the ingenious idea of combining salty and sweet?! And the price. The soft serve itself is 6$ and the cornflakes are an extra 1.25$. The whole thing comes out to about 8$ with tax. I have never paid so much for an ice cream and this is the worse ice cream I've ever had (I didn't even finish it... Me! Not finishing an ice cream?!). Perfect combination for a 1-star.",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,1
"This is a fairly average cafe overall. The food offerings are slight and not meal-level, the pastries (that I've had) are unimpressive, the coffee is mediocre, the layout is spastic, the furnishings are uncomfortable, it is not particularly good for pleasant conversation or getting work done. It is, however, open 24 hours everyday and that makes it a great destination after 11:00pm when all the other cafes in town have closed. The service is good and the people working there are very friendly -- just as I would expect for such a friendly city. It has great potential if they can upscale the tables and chairs to more practical and comfortable pieces, improve the lighting, decrease the background noises, and make the layout more attractive, functional, and cohesive.",Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,3
"I am officially in love. Sinful Sweets DESTROYS any chocolate/candy store in existence. Not only do they have awesome, friendly, fun staff, but the expansive selection of chocolates, truffles, cake pops AND ice cream is fantastic. They even have samples of their chocolate out to try! Sure, the building this little place resides in may be a bit run down, but I think it just gives it personality! The shop inside is cute and modern. Milkshake Happy Hour (25% off from 4-7 p.m.)!! The girl working (I wish I'd gotten her name!) was awesomely patient and helpful as I debated for several minutes between flavors. Finally, I decided to go wild and got bittersweet symphony (coffee & chocolate), mint chocolate chip, red velvet, chocolate cookie dough & piece of cake (since you get four scoops of ice cream, I split the cake and cookie dough flavors). At my request, she blended in tons of (free!) extras, like Reese's and Butterfingers pieces. Finally, I asked her to top my shake with Andes mints, which she did enthusiastically. It came with a big, fat cute straw DIPPED in chocolate on the tip for an extra burst of chocolately goodness with each sip. She said it was the craziest shake she had made yet :) IT WAS HEAVEN. I'm surprised I didn't spiral into depression at the final sip. All the extras that didn't get blended in were at the bottom, soaked in milkshakey goodness, so I got to spoon it out for even more deliciousness. Go here. You will be addicted.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5

"I like their donuts a lot so when my wedding planning got to the cake-picking point Jack Frost was top of my list. I am very disappointed by the flexibility for scheduling a tasting. Every other cake vendor, including the one that ultimately got my $500+ order, was able to accommodate evenings and weekend schedules. Jack Frost was not. The woman I was emailing with ultimately rudely stopped answering my emails trying to schedule a time. I used to take all of my out-of-town visitors Jack Frost for a taste of Cleveland but I am super disappointed by their service on a few of my last visits and with scheduling a tasting.",unknown,Positive,Negative,unknown,3
"Updating my review to this place because I went back with my boyfriend a second time. Although the girl working was really nice, I had noticed that there were no chocolate based flavors. For how many options they had, I thought that was a little crazy to not have a traditional chocolate flavor (or even a chocolate peanut butter or something). Biggest reason for the review change---Last time I rated this place, my boyfriend was the one making the purchase, so he paid. This time, we went for the special they have which adds a macaroon and a toasted marshmallow on top of your ice cream. I thought the menu board said they were $10 each (which is too much money for what you get, in my opinion). I remember tipping on top of it. And then when I checked my bank statement the next day, it said I spent $28.24 here. Almost $30 for essentially two scoops of ice cream plus some toppings?! PASS! I don't think I'll come back here if these are their prices because their ice cream is not worth that much. Even had I tipped 20% (which I think I did), it should have been $25 (again too much....) so to randomly add an over $8 tip is outrageous for what you are getting. I'm not sure how that happened but I doubt I'd come back. If I do....someone else better be paying.",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,2
"Because I enjoy watching the show on TV, I was expecting an incomparable experience when tasting the products in the store. I would have preferred the lobster tail dough to be softer however the cream filling was delicious with a touch of liqueur. The cannoli was average and I expected the cup cakes a little more moist and soft. Cheese cake flavor did not stand out from others I've tried. I liked half moon and chocolate butter cookies. I also wanted chocolate covered strawberries, but there were none for sale. I feel you are definitely paying for celebrity and not flavor",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,2

"This used to be a fantastic, unique spot to grab a delicious treat, but in the last couple years this place has lost its appeal. Arrogant service people, groups of people that hang out for hours on end, long lines that can last up to 45 minutes, and lack of parking coupled with the scandal over employee pay have taken the lustre off what was a unique spot in Charlotte. The treats are still amazing, but I hate actually going.",Negative,Positive,Negative,unknown,2
Was recently in Vegas and wanted to drop by to visit the famous Carlos Bakery from Cake Boss. It was actually very disappointing and a huge let down. All I tried was the chocolate cannoli so maybe I didn't have the right thing but... It was sold in a pack of 6 for $30. The favor was not there and it just tasted frozen. It left a weird aftertaste too that was also unpleasant. I would say Carlos Bakery is a pass!,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,2

But beyond that, this place is definitely a staple of the Old Brooklyn area and a legend in it's own right. I only go once every couple of years but it definitely never disappoints. Best part about this particular location is it's outdoor seating area.",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
I dig hanging out here. I am a fan of anything open all hours of the day. When you walk into Amelie's there is a homely feeling that makes me want to order half of the pastries from the case and post up in the living room (a personal fave chill spot) forever. I work here on occasion when the office walks start to wear on me. It's also a super good late night hang out after a show at the Evening Muse. A neighborhood gem.,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,4

Highly recommend. There was no line so it was quick and easy. The only thing I'd say is it would be nice if the woman taking my order would have been a bit friendlier. I don't think she said 2 words to me, and she certainly didn't smile.",unknown,Positive,Negative,unknown,4
While the ice cream looked delicious - there was no frozen yogurt. I was led astray! But this place sure is popular - the line was out the door. I am on a quest for a local yogurt joint - not sure why Yelp lists this as both a yogurt & ice cream shop.,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,1

They even have small portions so you don't have to feel guilty about picking out ten desserts. I've never been disappointed with anything but the tarts are my favorite. The staff is always willing to answer questions and help you pick something out. Unique French themed decor matched with a positive vibe. My only complaint is that I don't live there.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"The ice cream was so wonderful, it was soft & sweet & the perfect amount of flavor in each bite! We tried so many different flavors and literally every single one was good!! I got the (I think it was called) sugar cookie which was to die for! My boyfriend got the lavender flavor, I didn't try it but he did say it was so good & after every bite he took he talked about how good it was! I personally couldn't get o we the real lavender pieces but he loved it! NOW onto the service. The 2 workers there were SO nice & explained everything & every ice cream to us which i thought was really sweet! They asked us how we heard of them we told them we just ate up the street so they asked us how our dinner was & they genuinely seemed interested in our night! & then THEY thanked US for allowing them to be apart of our night not just ""thanks for coming in"" which I thought was so cool!

"Truly a disappointing experience. Having been to many 85 locations in CA, I had high hopes that this location would be an amazing addition to my new hometown. I came on Sunday, 3/8/20 at about 5:30 pm. There was a long line but that didn't initially bother me. However, when you enter the store, the line for the checkout (staffed by one cashier) was wrapped around inside. The line was right thru the middle of the pastry selection area, making it difficult to make any selection for the few pastries that were out as the people in line wouldn't move, even after asking politely if you could reach around them to select a pastry. The young man at the checkout was pleasant and very apologetic for the wait. I assured him I knew it wasn't his fault. Inadequate staffing is a managers fault and I saw no manager assisting in the mess I saw occurring in that store. What disgusted me to no end was the employee working the coffee bar. His hair was unkept and long and sticking out everywhere. He seemed to have no feeling of any urgency to do his job, as he was wandering all over the store while people stood waiting for their drinks. He wandered several times to the back of the store behind the swinging doors and then would wander back to the coffee making area and never washed his hands. The part where I wanted to vomit was when he made the drink, then carried it over across the aisle with his hand over the top of the cup - now full with coffee (there is no assembly line format for making drinks so it's very disorganized). I know that a food handlers permit is required in CA so I'm going to assume that one is required in NV as well. All the things I saw with this last employee violate the health code. And with the world gone mad about the coronavirus, it would behoove this particular employee to take health precautions seriously or find other employment. I did not have him remake my drink (as I was late for an engagement). And didn't have time to wait another 30 mins for a drink. It found its way to the trash instead.",Negative,unknown,Negative,unknown,1

Why do I look so caramel cashew-y??? It wasn't bad, don't get me wrong! I didn't complain so my bad. I was mostly creeped out when he called me by name after looking at my credit card so I didn't want to point out his mistake.

I love how they shout ""fresh bread"" when they bring new trays out. I don't know it was fun to me haha. They have all my favorites. And some new stuff. Of course every other day they will have different breads, it's not always guaranteed and that's fine. Try something new. It's a bakery. And if an item is more popular one day over the other, they might run out. Good for them! There's a lot of folks still in training, but really nice. Be patient. It's a new location with new workers. I had a great experience. My partner fell in love with the place :) Thank you for being in Las Vegas!",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"The best ice cream I have ever had! I know have a reason to move to Phoenix/Scottsdale and the reason is Sweet Republic. The menu is like a all star list of ice cream and it took me a while to make a decision of what to try beyond the obvious everything. I went for a classic with the Madagascar Vanilla and a unique flavor with the Honey Blue Cheese to try to get an idea of Sweet Republic's range. WOW, they blew me away. The honey blue cheese was an oddly wonderful taste that I enjoy in its normal incarnation but found the ice cream version to be somehow better! The flavors were well developed and not over powering, especially the blue cheese which could have been a bully and ruined everything. A subtly savory sweet treat! The Madagascar vanilla was nothing short of perfect, the flavor was dead on, texture was perfect and best of all the silky creaminess worked together to develop my first official ice cream addiction needing intervention. The iconic ice cream flavor has a new high mark set with this one. I will without hesitation go out of my way to stop in at Sweet Republic anytime I am in the state of Arizona. My only request (dream) is that they have a tasting menu. I would gladly hand over $10-20+ for a well rounded spoonful of each flavor available. Out of this world Sweet Republic, thank you for delivering the best culinary experience during my stay in Arizona",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"I worked in a bakery for 3 years and swore off donuts from then on (about 8 years ago)... until I encountered Jack Frost Donuts. Then I came back to the dark side. I've been saying for awhile that I needed to venture out there and finally made it this past weekend. It was worth the drive. I got the maple bacon (!!!), German chocolate, and some chocolate creme deliciousness. All of it was great. Will be back for sure.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"One of the few dessert places on the Strip that was recommended to me before I left for Christmas holiday. This is located inside the Cosmopolitan hotel. It is not obvious to find as the hotel malls themselves are a bit of a challenge to navigate through. Just as we were about to give up we found it...by luck. I got the fruity pebbles cereal soft serve. The soft serve was okay. I know that there are better ones in Vegas which I have been to (and will review later as I am catching up on all the Vegas reviews). It was super expensive, therefore, I shared a cone with my best friend which worked out for the best since we were going to a buffet later that day anyway. There is some sit down space inside but decided to just walk around the rest of the mall. Customer service was neutral.",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,3
"I woke up this morning... 7 AM... because I was going to go try The Donut Bar. There was so much hype about this place from USA today to the food network to Ellen. I was energized and ready to go! I got there at 7:50 in the morning and it was easy to find parking. There was already a line of at least 40 people ahead of me who were also waiting for a shop that was about to open at 8 AM. The wait time to get in once the shop opens at 8 AM was 30 minutes in line outside. Luckily, it was a pleasant day. As I approached the inside of the store, I was surprised to see that I wasn't all that excited. I saw many very large looking donuts with hard tacky frosting that weren't at all appealing. The oversized amount made them less appealing rather than to appear yummy. The smaller donuts looked good and, by smaller, I mean normal size like Dunkin' Donuts regular donuts. The service was just OK. Whoever chose to run this place really doesn't seem to understand what the best environment for customer service is. It was glaring super loud music over the speakers where I could barely hear the person helping me and I'm not sure if they could hear me. I had to order several donuts for a party and thought this is a good place to try because it gets so much publicity so it has to be good. I decided to put my instincts aside because so many people were waiting in front of me and behind me to get into this place and it has gotten all these reviews. As I ordered, after two dozen donuts, the server just went off to help somebody else without even asking me if I was finished with my order. I couldn't believe it! I was very friendly during the whole interaction which is why this shocked me. I did not bother calling her back because I am not confrontational and simply will let something like this go, but won't let it go during a review. The donuts range from two dollars that are very small to some pastries that are upwards of four dollars. I ordered several donuts including the Twix, Samoa, blueberry with lemon, chai, Nutella, Red velvet, and the crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e. Here is what I have to say: firstly, you have to eat these donuts the day of because they are not as good the next day. With that being said, most of the donuts were not that impressive to begin with. They were just ok or disappointing. In fact, the crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e donut, which gets all of this amazing hype, was one of the worst ones of the bunch. The hard sugar/Caramel crust on top of the donut was so burnt that it carried a foul aftertaste. The donut itself had a yummy crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e center within the dough. The topping of the crunchy burnt sugar/Caramel ruined it. I also did not like that many of the donuts were grossly over sized with a great deal of tacky frosting on it which was glazed and dried off. I did order a couple of those and they were not very good. This place is OK. I did not try the coffee and I wonder if that would've changed my mind and increased their ratings. The donuts are so so. They aren't that much better than other places or don't cost a lot less so I do not know what people are talking about. Also, the wait time and price just isn't worth it. It is a very popular place and a lot of people come here. Not sure if there are people that love donuts so much that this is considered great quality??? I love food and have been very fortunate to taste some phenomenal food internationally at some of the best places. I know donuts and sadly, the donut bar does not have anywhere close to the best donuts around. The two stars are because it is expensive, the service was disappointing, the wait time to get the donuts was way too long for this,and the donuts did not impress. I am glad I tried it just take the hype away and I should have gone with my instincts.",Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,2

"I had a breakfast sandwich, and it was just okay. It wasn't hot all the way through, so it wan't the best. The coffee was pretty good, and the honey bun I split with my bf was excellent. The staff was fairly nice, but not overly helpful. The worst was that there were some seriously annoying high school wannabe-hipster girls in there who were yapping loudly at the table next to us. One of them sent her food back because, as she told the server, she was ""allergic to dairy,"" even though she then told her friends (quite loudly) that, really, she was just ""trying the whole vegan thing, like, lol!""

Maybe it's because I was born and raised in Hoboken and was able to enjoy these pastries with no line before the fame so I may be biased. The pastries fir years have been amazing so I never mind the wait. To me it taste awesome but it's a taste of my childhood and I would wait online to recapture that moment.

"TAIPEI BAKERY EMPIRE 85° C BAKERY is mastering the bake industry like a monster typhoon. Huge dominance in So-Cal and now has moved north on I-95 anchoring itself as a foodie hot spot in Chinatown's Shanghai Plaza Las Vegas. Its actually a big bakery shop, but dine-in section is closed for good reasons. The area where you personally select your pasteries is a free for all zone without any observance for social distancing. Sorta like a mob after a storm when all the fish are washed a shore. It was a scene from a Charlie Chaplin fire drill. Then you get in a queue to pay, and it's stand apart with four feet spacing. The cashiers are spaced even closer.

"I made my first visit to Fatty Daddy's on January 8th with my two best friends just after the Phoenix Bridal Show. I heard heard numerous good things about this place and was so eager to try and see what that was all about. Unfortunately my experience was negative and I will not be returning. The afternoon my three friends and I walked into amazing customer service from a young boy who was so kind in serving our sweet treats, which were quite delicious. We sat inside the establishment that day because it was a little chilly. What unfolded afterwards blew my mind. It seems that the mother of the employee came in to speak to the (new) owner about a few issues so my company and I paid no attention. Shortly (and I mean very shortly) there after the management took the conversation to an altercation type level with raised voice and all. WE WERE SHOCKED. Owner was shouting, blaming the young boy aloud for a broken mug, saying he would not receive tips. I could NOT believe my eyes and ears. I felt awful for this boy and as customers, we were put in such an awkward position sitting there while this was taking place. Our sweet trip turned sour VERY quickly. It's a shame. We will not be returning and truly hope for the best of the employees that remain under the example of management we witnessed that afternoon.",Negative,Positive,Negative,Negative,1
Cute little shop. They have everything Ghirardelli has to offer. Great selection of chocolate. My only reason why I gave this a 3 star was the long wait. It's such a small shop there needs to be a better cashier system.,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,3
"I don't really like donuts but I heard this place is great, and I'll try anything once, so I decided to pick up a dozen and bring them into work the other day. I had to wait in line and there were people coming in after me as well, everyone was ordering 2 or 3 dozen donuts! I suppose this proved they are indeed popular and tasty! The lady who helped me with my order was personable, the place seemed clean, and the donuts did look quite nice. Oh and just a note, you have to pay with cash or check as they do not accept credit cards. Back to the donuts. I got a variety and my co-workers all said they tasted really good so that is what I am basing my review on. I did eat one and it was A-Ok, but it tasted like a regular donut to me so I can't really rate it on taste since it's not my thing, but I would definitely suggest this place to anyone who likes donuts! A dozen was only $10.95, so super cheap too!",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"I do enjoy Carlos bakery however it seems everytime I visit they have less variety that's why 4 stars and not 5. I remember the first time I visited they had danishes and smaller bites today they had cake slices, cheesecakes, cupcakes, lobster tails which seem smaller and cannolis.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"One of the best donuts in Cleveland! They specialize in their presentation, but don't let the pictures scare you off if you are into plain glazed. These are my favorite glazed donuts around! Perfectly fluffy with just the right amount of glaze... Goes great with a cup of coffee! If you are feeling adventurous, they even have bacon maple! Something here for everyone! They have both cake and raised donuts, it's hard to tell what they are under the toppings so make sure you get what you want! If something is missing don't be afraid to ask, sometimes they have more in the back!",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"We stopped by late one night and grabbed the ""favorites pack"" which came with Milk Bar Pie, a compost cookie, birthday cake bites and a small thing of their cereal milk soft serve with corn flakes on top. The cake bites were great, but the milk bar pie stole the show. The cookie was not our cup of tea, but I enjoyed the soft serve. It was a little less sweet and the corn flakes were a nice contrast.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"This is the only place to find matcha soft serve in North Carolina. Trust me I have looked. There are days when the matcha soft serve is grainy but most of the time is nice, creamy and rich! The ube is also a favorite of mine. I also highly recommend the addition of mochi balls (very chewy- the perfect texture to pair with silky soft serve.) The drinks are good but the soft serve is what they're known for. I live in RTP area but every time I visit Charlotte I always make sure to stop by. 10/10 would recommend if you like matcha and/or soft serve.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"We visited this place on our visit to Arizona and we would come back every week if we didn't live in the area! The quality of ice cream is so amazing and the flavors we're so refreshing.

The portions are large enough that it can be shared. The service is good and after a nice walk at the LinQ , it's always a great feeling to relish the sundae.

"I've received a few recommendations from friends about this spot! It's close to my home but slightly off the main Central shopping area. You'll see it on the other side of hwy 74. The shop itself is small, cute, and smells incredible! Park in the open gravel lot and enjoy your pastries on the picnic tables, no inside seating. The employees were helpful when I shared it was my first time and wanted to try the ""favorites"". They recommended the tiramisu, lemon bar, s'mores bar, or slice of cheesecake. There was cookies, puff pastries filled with cream, brownies, macarons, and more! I wanted everything. The lemon bar was great, the s'mores bar was del delicious, and the lobster tail was awesome! I can't wait to come back and try more.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Brioche was soft and moist Sandwich cookies in a variety of fun flavors: peanut butter caramel, lemon blueberry, strawberry & cream. Service is pleasant and helpful for new comers like us.

We'll be back for more treats!",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Mitchell's is one of the things about Cleveland which will make it hard to leave when the time comes. I am not an ice cream person, but when I am, I am a snob. If it isn't great, it isn't worth it. First, I love that they are very open and honest and meticulous about where they source their ingredients. Everything that can be purchased locally, is purchased locally. Second, I love that they have interesting and unique flavors. The Edmund Fitzgerald Porter ice cream is my favorite that I have ever had. It is not uncommon to find a pint of it in my freezer. I've also been stunned by the decadence of the caramelized chocolate. I don't love chocolate ice cream, but this is just amazing. Not too sweet. I've also tried most of their seasonal flavors--berry crumble, peach, apple cider concoctions, pumpkin spice, juniper/olive oil/orange--all amazing. They taste exactly the way that they should taste except better and creamier. Third, having cut dairy almost completely out of my everyday diet, their vegan ice cream is fantastic. Their vegan ice cream is better than most regular ice creams. It is wonderful, rich, creamy, good flavors, absolute excellence. The cookie dough ice cream has massive chunks of cookie dough in it. The peanut butter chocolate concoctions have loads of peanut butter and chocolate. It's a beautiful thing. The portions are generous (I usually get a junior size or a pint to go). If you're in the area, indulge. Mitchell's is fantastic.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
Tried crack pie and most cookie flavors. Pie wasn't what I expected and tasted just ok.... very rich dense butter solid filling ...don't eat the entire slice in one sitting...can't believe the astronomical cost for a whole pie...over 50+... cookies were meh......liked the corn one best,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,3

"Doughnuts are good. It's even better if they come vegan, which are hard to find but you can find these here. The Vegan Doughnut Company is a small store. A counter displays all the doughnuts. You can get a box or bring a container here with you. Handcrafted doughnuts like these are better than any you get commercially. It tastes so much fresher, because these are actually made here. They always have a large variety. All the flavors sound good. Some of the flavors include classics like chocolate and vanilla. A few more exotic flavors include banana nut, maple with coconut bacon pieces, and strawberry. The donuts are $2 each, which isn't bad for something like this. It tastes just like regular donuts. That means they're good, and while they may not be much healthier they're made of higher quality. It doesn't have any room to sit inside. Outside there's a picnic table along the wall so there's somewhere close to sit. They have somewhat limited hours plus they close when they run out, which",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4

"Churn is awesome, I make a point to visit whenever I'm in the area. The pretzel cone is simply a must try. Pretzel cone with peanut butter ice cream is my go to.

"UPDATED REVIEW -- The 2 young women who own this vegan doughnut shop are the sweetest. They are truly passionate about their business. It is so awesome to see a black owned business in Lakewood. I am always greeted with a smile and I feel welcomed anytime I come here. Now that I've tried other doughnuts in the Cleveland area, I will say that these are tasty. They are soft but actually a bit too sweet. It is almost as if you can taste the sugar. I especially feel this when I taste the Lavender doughnut. These are vegan doughnuts so they are made without milk. I do appreciate that the price has gone down from $3 a doughnut to $2 a doughnut which is affordable. I will be back here but the hours here are still limited. They are opened Fridays - Sundays.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"Hmm...I'm in shock that I haven't reviewed Sweet Republic sooner. This place was one of my favorites when I lived in Phoenix so I assumed I had already written a review....my apologies SR! Good thing I made it out for a visit this past weekend and made sure to stop by for some dessert after dinner. This place is so cute and has the greatest flavor combinations ever! I would love to sample all of the different flavor creations as they are so intriguing but I always feel bad about holding up the line. There is usually always a nice crowd in this shop...not crazy busy but good steady business. Who am I to delay people from their yummy goodness that is SR's ice cream? In any case, I usually end up going with tried and true favorites like I Love Bacon and Salted Caramel. This time around they didn't have the bacon ice cream so I went with their Sweet Potato and it was so delicious. Definitely put me in the mood for Thanksgiving! The quality of their ice cream is really great and you just can't beat some of their exciting flavor combinations. Basil Lime is so refreshing! When we lived in AZ we would always take our out of town guests here for some treats. Don't forget to pick up a pack of Bacon Brittle at the register!",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5

The service is consistently friendly. The scoop shop is always clean. I will wait in line, I will park at a distance and walk, I will wait in the rain, I will try new flavors, I will support this little gem for as long as I live in Charlotte. Thank you for coming, you are amazing! AND BY GOD, GET THE BUTTERCRISP CONE. By the time you're on your last two bites it's like a salty sugar cookie absorbing the last drips of your chosen flavor.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5

"I'm not sure what the hype of this place is. I had to wait outside in the heat to be able to order, as they are limiting the number of people inside the store. I got a peach ice cream cone, which was alright. I was feeling nostalgic for peach ice cream from back home and this was an okay way to get my fix. The entire visit took a little more than an hour from the time I got in line to when I finished ordering. I probably won't be visiting again. I don't think the wait time, price, and quality of the product justify coming back.",unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,2
"The dichotomy is to die for!!! Campbell's is amazing! I've been to the Lakewood location, the westside market and I've been happy with them all.

We rode our bikes to Jarling's on a Saturday and I had the smallest serving of a Coffee Chocolate Chip (my FAVORITE 2 flavors!) Snowstorm.

"Ok this is just a regular bakery at the Venetian right? Ummm this is one of the best bakeries I have ever been to in my life! The taste of all of their pastries is just mouth watering! - croissant: it is the flakiest buttery croissant I ever had! It's huge but will be gone in 3 seconds. There is a few different kinds of croissants and can't go wrong with any of them. But the best to me is the original one - macaroons: all huge! Usually macaroons are a bit chewy or dry. Their center filling is super creamy and light! Which was a shock for me. Can't go wrong with any of the flavors but my favorite is pistachio and earl grey! - muffins: honestly their muffin is great. It's super moist and chewy. Maybe I'm not a muffin fan. Wasn't that impressed - cookies: there is a few variations of cookies. All great but I still think I had better. All in all, great stop if your at the Venetian. They have sandwiches and coffee which I have yet to try. But if I wanted that then I would go to grand Lux next door and I feel like it would be a lot better. No you come here for bakeries. All are amazing and can't go wrong at all in any choice you make. The only down side is that the service is a bit slow, they aren't as organized, and under staffed where it is only one or two people working. Also, the price! It is Vegas after all but usually each baked goods will be about 5 bucks each. But the size does make up for it, still kind of pricey since I usually leave with a good box full. -",unknown,Positive,Negative,unknown,4
"Mm mm, smells good, looks good, tastes good. Hit the trifecta. The glass cases are filled with gems. Fresh crusty breads with my favorite being their epi, a French bread that looks like a branch. It is beautiful gift when you are invited to dinner at friend's house. Their sweets are divine. Little sandwich cookies that are just plain beautiful and slices of apple cake. Their chocolate chip cookies are excellent. Scones and brownies call your name and you pace wanting to pick just the right thing. They make lovely cakes that are gorgeous and perfect for a sophisticated celebration. I hope to see you staring at the cases soon. You won't be sorry.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5

"I literally cannot stop laughing about this place. I mean, the sheer audacity of Brandon and Jenny Douglas to serve such unapologetically sinful desserts like this is just beyond comprehension. Warm donuts stuffed with ice cream? Waffle ice cream sandwiches? With cereal toppings? And a variety of glass bottled soda offerings? To those grossed out by this boldness, you might as well leave this review now. Me? I just had to see this for myself. After a soft opening in early March, I went to the Grand Opening Saturday night, appropriately enough the same weekend as Art Detour. Located on Grand Avenue & Fillmore in the same complex as ThirdSpace, Novel occupies the red building in back that has seen a number of concepts come and go over the years, but none with such an eye popping slogan out front as ""Ice Cream Stuffed Donuts"". Downtown Phoenix is certainly a friendly breeding ground for entrepreneurial experimentation, but could something this crazy actually work? Brandon and Jenny were delightful from the moment I walked in the door, and you can pick up on just how passionately devoted they are to their bold new concept. The ice cream flavors are made to their own specs, the donuts and waffles are made fresh in house, and they'll pretty much let you sample as many flavors as you want. With bold flavors like Bourbon Caramel Toffee Crunch, Cookie Monster, and Panna Cotta Cherry, as well as more familiar offerings like Butter Pecan, Madagascar Vanilla, and Mint. I counted 14 different flavor offerings this go around. If the ice cream and pastry combination wasn't crazy enough, did I mention toppings? From cereals? You've got options like Captain Crunch, Cookie Crisp, Fruity Pebbles, Fruit Loops and even Cocoa Puffs. I was craving a waffle this go around, so for me tonight would be a date with me and the Leslie Knope. And yes that is an entirely intentional reference to Amy Poehler's character on Parks & Rec. Two fresh made waffles with ice cream and a topping in the middle. My kryptonite of choice? Honey Lavender ice cream and Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Normally $5, tonight it was discounted at $3 for the grand opening (though I would've happily paid $5 for this magic). After a few minutes it was put together and placed in wax paper for sandwich style portability. The first bite had me filled with thoughts that I should maybe be remorseful for this obscene creation, but no, no I was not remorseful at all. Let's pretend calorie and cholesterol numbers don't count and I'll instead just tell you this is really good for you, and it will make you happy. Add Novel to the growing list of great restaurants dotting the landscape on Downtown's Grand Avenue food scene including Treehouse Bakery, Irma's Kitchen, and Barrio Cafe Gran Reserva. In addition to donuts and waffles stuffed with ice cream and toppings, they offer soda floats, traditional ice cream scoops on a waffle (or pretzel) cone, and even an ice cream flight of 5 flavors. And not a single item on the menu is more expensive than $8. Novel might leave you laughing about what you've just done to your diet or embarrassed to admit what you've eaten, but I think you'll find the mixed emotions worth the trouble. It may be early in Brandon and Jenny's fledgling concept, but from what I can see, they've hit on a winner.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5

"Who doesn't love ice cream, but this homemade ice cream takes the cake!!! There are so many fun flavors that are different from the usual chocolate and vanilla. I tried the lavender, but ultimately for the blackberry crumble which had berry bites with pieces of crumble scattered throughout. It was light, refreshing with great texture. There were some seats inside but mostly outside on stools and a few tables. I went in the mid afternoon so it was pretty hot and limited shaded seats outside but want to come back to try another flavor!!!",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5

"With Blue Bell off the shelf, Sweet Republic is a good fallback for creamy rich ice cream. The more you care about the quality of ice cream the more you will like this place.

Amelie's has a unique atmosphere with a fun, fast moving crowd waiting to devour all of the delicious goodies presented in the glass cases. Don't get overwhelmed.

Favorite items are: CrÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e Salted caramel brownie Palmiers Anything with fruit on it All of the soups & sandwiches are amazing The employees are amazing, the location is amazing, and the amount of seating is usually wonderful. Even if you can't find seating in the main building, there is extra seating outside as well as in the atrium in the back. I have been at many different times of the day and always can find a seat. Even if the tables get a bit crowded most people use the ""sharing is caring"" policy & if you have available seat you can invite others to sit with you. It's a fun way to meet new people :)",Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,5
"Boasting an astonishing variety of lovingly prepared ice cream and related tempting sweet treats all served fresh in a crisp, state of the art environment, Mitchell's is a world class establishment through and through. Though they have gradually attained something of a celebrity status in recent years, the fine folks at Mitchell's sacrifice none of their grassroots integrity in pursuit of turning larger profits. And their flavors just keep on getting tastier. The pralines & cream, while a bit of an underdog, according to one staff member, may be the best ice cream I've ever had the extreme good fortune of tasting. The 25th Street location is a gem: a sort of space age Wonka's workshop looms behind the order line, offering guests a firsthand view of just where the magic happens. The staff are upbeat and generous in their portioning. Overall, Mitchell's is a worthy contender for most consistent sweet tooth satiation station in Cleveland. Pete & Mike should be proud.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5

I came here because it was on yelp what else! the girl behind the counter was nice. they have a salted caramel topping - not ice cream. I ended up getting two scoops - a pecan and the coffee ice cream with the caramel and additional pecans on top. i asked another customer about other creameries in the city and she said this was the best one in town.

"So okay donut fans! I didn't think I would ever break away from my 40 year DD habit, but I found something better than those ""wicked donuts from DD"". I had forgotten how tasty a donut can be until I stumbled upon this place while hanging in Downtown LV. Seriously, these guys know how make a donut explode with tastiness on your tongue. Somehow they found a way to artistically create a culinary composition of a clever captivation that just wows your senses. This is the kind of experience that one must repeat, and I would strongly urge you to make this a regular spot for you and yours!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
Went here for Valentine's Day with my girl and it was really good. Everything they make from scratch. I really liked the fact that the marshmallows were also home made. Everything was tasty the flavors were also really innovative. The sea salt caramel and the Irish whiskey were great. I'd love for them to maybe do more in the future like cookies as an option instead of macrons but those were really tasty as well.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Good spot to grab some ice cream if you're staying @ the Palazzo (which we usually do), or at the Venetian, or are just shopping around the Grand Canal Shoppes. Probably wouldn't drive all the way here for just Sloan's, but again, it's a great option. It's tucked away in a small area of the shoppes right in front of the bridge that crosses over to the other side of the shoppes. Walk in and get in line, it forms a ""U"" shape that pretty much follows the walls of the little place, but just know that there are two registers, which can get a little confusing, esp when the lines get long, because the windows between each set of registers do not have the same exact flavors, at least not the last time I checked. A lot of options to pick from, and don't worry about the people behind, because you really should take your time and look at everything they have to offer. I've had a few flavors already, and liked them all so far; butter pecan, pistachio, mint n chip, vanilla. $5 for ice cream, which is expected 'round these parts, esp cuz of where you're at, but it's not a deal breaker. One of the last times we went, my little one opted for the Cookiewich, which from the picture on the menu on the wall doesn't look big, but i should've known once I saw that the price was $10...it's huge. They should've called it the giantwich, haha. Anyway, you can choose 3 cookies I think (I went with choc chip, so I don't even remember what the other options were), and you can choose your ice cream; she went vanilla, which was a great choice. It was pretty good, but even me at my hungriest couldn't finish that thing...prob meant to be shared with like 2 or 3 people. There are a lot of other options and even stuff to pickup while you're waiting in line, but it's all a little overwhelming and I never check it out because I typically just want ice cream and want to get back to the casino asap, hehe. Service has always been good for us, so nothing to complain about there either. It's not coldstone level, and they won't sing if you tip either, but it's decent.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,4

"I'm not new to 85 degrees, but wanted to share a review on to yelp! Once they've opened one in Vegas, a good majority of my money went here buying bread for my family, boba runs, and cakes for parties. -- Covid-19 review: Rules and regulations have changed since before Covid. Now that LV is in its second wave of reopening things, I've noticed that they don't regulate the amount of people who are inside the store with someone monitoring the entrance. -- Arrival: They practice social distancing with X's telling you where to stand. Each of the bread is individually wrapped and masks (just like everywhere else) are mandatory prior to entering the store. Sitting areas are closed. -- Staff: Everyone is wearing a mask and gloves. There is glass in front of the cashier to ensure social distancing rules. They're all so hardworking and make sure that the bread remains stocked. It's extremely busy with every customer grabbing more than at least 5+ items per visit. -- Menu: Their drink menu stays the same with new seasonal drinks being promoted here and there. The bread is kind of like a game of chance, you never know what's on display and there's no way to ensure you'll get a certain type of bread since it's in a first come first serve basis. -- Price: Extremely reasonable! For the amount they make everyday and the popularity of the location, I'm surprised they keep it at such a low price. Such a good reason to come back and try new items. -- FOOD: - Every food and drink is really top notch/consistent. Any location I visit, whether it's Vegas or Cali, the pastries all taste the same and rarely really misses the mark. -- Bonus: The times when you go and the bread you want is actually there, it's all worth it. -- Recommend?

And from the high perch of Saturday morning television, he often pontificated to the country's youth on how breakfast was the ""most important meal of the day."" For too many years, I took ""most important"" to mean ""very large."" That led to many unconfortable weekend days saddled with the results of Shoney's Breakfast Bar or some other horrible, oversized breakfast, sometimes administered in an effort to cure a hangover (but almost always exacerbating it). Having learned the error of my ways, I still think of breakfast as very important, but it's also important to keep it light. A place like Amelie's French Bakery is perfect for that. It has reasonably-sized, reasonably-priced egg sandwiches served on surprisingly decent baguettes, accompanied by very good coffee. There are plenty of great-looking pastries as well, although I didn't try those. You get to enjoy this fare in a dining area that looks like an undergrad's fantasy of classical French sophistication. I mean that in a good way: It's got a shabby-chic and comfortable appeal to it. Impressively, Amelie's is open 24 hours a day, and I suspect that the surroundings would seem a bit surreal if you came here after a bender in the middle of the night.",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,4

We got the 5 pack of cannoli and 4 pack of lobster tails variety pack each. It was very delicious. The price was a little steep we paid 47.00 for both. I can say i ate at carlo's bakery and had the cannoli for 47 dollars. No line we were in and out very quickly. I enjoyed the experience can i find cheaper cannoli somewhere else? Maybe. Will it be as good as carlo's . But for my first Cannoli at least i have a good starting point for what i know is a good cannoli.,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"I, like everyone else, saw the creme brulee cracking video on Facebook, so i had to try this place. I was in town for my bachelorette party, but i visit every month so its like I still live here. I ordered a shit ton of donuts the night before because that's the only way u can try these donuts and guarantee you get what they make that day, without waiting in line. Metered parking out front, long ass line out the door. Walked right up and asked for my order. Was prompt, staff was friendly. Donuts were meh. The best part was cracking the donut in person. Everything else was grocery store quality.",unknown,Negative,Positive,unknown,2
Great tasting food. A must visit if you are in Las Vegas. This isn't your typical donut spot.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5

"I thought this place was all hype, but it's definitely one of the few that lives up to it! We came back several times during our Vegas trip and got cereal milk with corn flakes soft serve every time. SO GOOD!!!!!!!! Not only is it coated with the corn flakes at the top but also at the bottom of the ice cream. I knocked off one star because I was able to try 3 of the cookies (blueberry, compost, & chocolate chocolate), I'm not sure if I got a bad batch or it's suppose to taste as salty as they all were. Also, please do yourself a favor & try the crack pie. You will not be disappointed.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"More gluten free options please!! I wanted a cupcake bad and figured with all their cupcake options in the case, one of them had to be GF. They weren't, but as a consolation prize they had a personal cheesecake covered in chocolate that was. It was delicious, not too sweet and not overly rich.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
Meh. Ice latte was good. The cake I got was kind of dry and it definitely wasn't very freshly baked because the butter cream kind of fell off it.,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,2
"For us their bakery kiosk was conveniently located near our suite's elevators. Content that I got my macaron fix quelled due to its larger portion size. Their confection is bigger than the average macarons. No complaints from this carber -_0 Plus thanks for the hot water (brought my own oolong in the suite). Upon the initial chomp, the generous raspberry macaron was puffy, chewy, fruity, and creamy. The buttercream oozed out w/each bite - nothing wrong w/that. I actually prefer buttercream over ganache. But to each their own of course. Their espressos are espressos and cupcakes are...you get my point. Hubs just needed a quick shot of caffeine and he's into chocolates. That may be sufficed anywhere. Focus on their puffed pastries and fritters. Next time we're in LV I've gotta try their chocolate croissant. They ran out so that triggered my curiosity. Next time Bouchon...next time.

Love this place! I walked there from my house and I will be back the next time I am craving ice cream (which is often). They have a variety of flavors and I love how you can get a marshmallow and a macaroon on top of your scoops. For sure a hidden gem.,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5

"When you walk in the smell is amazing! No matter how long the line-up they get you through pretty courteously including the opportunity to taste along the way. I have only seen one of their employee's be a little on the ""snotty"" side of things so not bad considering the amount of people. Lots of flavors to choose from so you shouldn't have an issue. Besides ice cream you can get other assortments of sundaes or banana splits or just buy a pint or two to take home with you. For my taste buds it is good.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5

Well worth the trip coz they are delicious!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5

The cupcakes are amazing! I always stop to bring some home. The service is decent but not overly friendly. The cookies are disappointing and I can make better ones at home. The ice cream is just ok. Stick with the cupcakes and you can't go wrong. My favorites are the peanut butter chip and chocolate peanut butter. I also like the snores and salted Carmel but those were only a month special and they no longer sell them.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"I think Sprinkles is a delightful experience. After watching Cupcake Wars on Netflix, I was inspired to google them and found they has a store and a cupcake ATM right here in Vegas! Adorable place and neat location. I was in the area staying at the Linq (Then Quad) a year ago, I had a horrible experience. Sprinkles and all of the wonderful shops just opened up around February this year. I am looking forward to visiting this location again. The coffee is also a reasonable price. I loved it. The reason it is only getting 4 stars is because some of the flavors aren't as awesome as I thought they would be. The banana cupcake tasted like an overly sweet banana bread. The coconut is the best and I also enjoyed the salty caramel. I still have many flavors to try. Didn't have a chance to use the ATM, but someone else did and it took 10 minutes for the cupcake to come out. I don't know if it is suppose to take that long. The staff was very helpful and had great personalities. Overall a lovely place to visit have a cupcake and cup of coffee.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"I have been dying to try their ice cream for a while now, ever since my co-workers told me about it. So my family and I went here today and we were not disappointed! The staff was super nice! They were very patient with my two little girls, who kept asking questions at the same time and wanted to try ALL the flavors, lol. My kids ordered a scoop each of two different flavors, my hubby ordered two scoops of the caramel toffee (I can't remember the exact name) and I ordered two scoops of the honey lavender, which was delicious!! We really enjoy our ice cream. Hubs even loved his. They use real lavender flowers in the honey lavender and you can definitely taste the honey as well. The prices were a tad higher than what I'm used to paying when we go out for ice cream, but I'm okay with that since this is fresh, handmade ice cream. I'd definitely recommend this place and would also go here again! I do hope they move to a bigger location in the future because my one critique would be that it is a small place with no seating and I'd love to be able to sit down at a table with my family and eat ice cream.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"While staying at the Cosmopolitan , I was trying to stop at as many restaurants as possible and have the best LV dining experience as I could. Milk Bar is right near Egg Slut & the Juice Standard (reviews below) in the Boulevard Tower. To forewarn you, the menu is pretty extensive and a little bit difficult to navigate. I wasn't sure what I wanted - and that didn't help either. The girl at the register whose name is Lissa, helped me through the ordering process. She went through each of the things they offer and told me what the most popular items were & what her personal favorites were as well. That helped me figure out my order. I knew I wanted to do the three cookies for $10 deal and I went for the chocolate chip marshmallow cookie, the confetti cookie, and the compost cookie which is supposed to be their most popular. They also had a blueberry flavor, and a corn meal - which Lissa said was her favorite. They also had a new birthday cake flavored - scented balm they were selling. Most people use it on their lips but it's concentrated enough that you can use it on your hands as well. I love birthday cake flavored/scented anything and everything so I purchased that as well for $12. To round it all off- Lissa said that her favorite thing on the menu as well as the most popular item was the birthday cake truffles. She said hands-down you need to get that. So for an additional six dollars I purchased that as well. For $28 I got three cookies, a lip - hand balm, and the birthday cake truffles which was a set of three. I have to say, I was not a big fan of the compost cookie or the chocolate chip marshmallow cookie. The lip - hand balm was good for the lips but not great anywhere else. Wasn't the best purchase. Now-in my opinion, the confetti flavored cookie was unreal. Sugar cookie with rainbow/funfetti sprinkles inside. Also, the birthday truffles were no joke! Yum status. There was not really a long line at all when we went. In fact, every time we walked by there didn't seem like a long line. However there are always a few people there which is a good sign. It's a tad on the Las Vegas pricey side, but that's what you would expect. I did get a lot for under $30. Get your sweet tooth on.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,3
"Wish I could give 6 stars! Amazing donuts. We got there around 10 am- rookie move as selection picked over and they apparently don't replenish- what they have is what they sell. Still had enough interesting varieties to make it worth the drive. Don't overlook the glazed- simple but better than any we'd ever had. The kinds with lots of frosting were, as expected, a big hit. Good service, great donuts- what else do you need??",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"This place is awesome. Do they have 300 flavors with 600 toppings? No. That's probably why this place is so awesome. I need to start out with something about the lady who was working. I'm assuming she was an owner or someone else deeply involved in the whole process, and she was more than willing to fill us in on where the ingredients came from or any other details which she deemed necessary. They mostly weren't necessary but when you have someone that is that into what they are doing, you gotta have some love for it. Between the 4 of us we probably had 12 or so samples, and we did so without a bad look or skip in the record of our servers in depth guide to the flavors. I settled on the salted caramel ice cream, which was phenomenal. Silky, smooth, and buttery like a kobe bryant jump shot. Its 9AM right now and my mouth is watering thinking about it. There are so many flavors that you just generally would never see and as weird as they may seem, they all taste great. Next time in Scottsdale, theres a good chance I will hopefully be able to visit this hot spot (cool spot) again.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"It's past midnight and still 90 degrees out. Cookies and ice cream sounded like the perfect snack. I'm not adventurous when it comes to ice cream because of my tree nut allergy so I had an oatmeal/sugar cookie (correction: snickerdoodle) vanilla ice cream sandwich. Both cookies were chewy, but a bit salty and didn't compliment the ice cream well. Even my friend thought I make a better cookie. The ice cream was a bit soft, but that's understandable with the Vegas heat. I will have to return to try a cupcake. They looked really good and had exotic flavors.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"I'm new in town and I love ice cream. I was excited to try this place because of the great reviews. I ordered a QT of Black Cherry and the Chocolate Malt with Caramel as well as the pineapple Sundae to go. The Sundae looked great, but when I got to the vanilla IceCream, it lacked the ""Vanilla"" and sugar, and tasted like creamy milk. I thought maybe I got a bad badge of vanilla IceCream. But when I finally tried the Black Cherry and the Chocolate Malt with Caramel....both were underwhelming as well. All the IceCream I ordered lacked sugar and how they're supposed to taste. The Black Cherry tasted just like the vanilla IceCream but with cherries and reddish food coloring and the chocolate malt was also lacking ""something"". I'm glad I tried this place, but I won't be back sadly. I gave it two stars because of how long I waited in line and how much I spent. It was edible and wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,2
"Delicious and generous amounts scooped here! They might be a little more expensive than Baskin Robbins, but they are so much better! A wide variety of flavors and seasonal ones to boot! I decided to go with the snickerdoodle cookie and mint ice cream. I am a huge fan of mint ice cream and this ice cream was not your average mint ice cream. I could taste that it was made with fresh mint and it was delicious! Can't wait to bring our friends here to try it out!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
I got the chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream sundae with the pumpkin cupcake and I wa just expecting more. There was a lot of cookie dough chunks in my ice cream but the ice cream and the chunks didn't have much flavor. My husband really liked the pumpkin cupcake.,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,1
"I've never had an authentic canoli before and it was yummy! My group and I had eaten at Trattoria for dinner and strolled down the streets of little Italy for something sweet. The Italian cookies were good, nothing too special, but the Gelato and the Canoli's were just what the doctor ordered! I was already stuffed from Trattoria, but I got a canoli, took 2 bites and brought it back to my hotel for after our nightly bar trip- perfect! I would highly recommend this place to daters out there as the late-night ambiance was quite beautiful, too bad the high school kids that worked there weren't a bit more friendly.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
The place is in a cool little area but the ice cream wasn't that great. It was okay but nothing special. It was tasteless. The salted caramel had way too much salt. This just could have been a bad batch. Probably wouldn't go back.,Positive,Negative,unknown,unknown,2

"I tried the macarons here when I indulged myself and got the six pack. For $17.50, I had high expectations considering Bouchon's reputation and all. Their macarons are twice the size of macarons that I've tried before so I was kind of digging that. Despite their bigger size, the taste and flavor were not compromised. The cream wasn't too sweet and the cookie part was soft and not dry. It's too bad that the pastry chef leader or team weren't there at the kiosk at the Venetian where I got these because I'd give each person a high-five for making such damn good macarons! It's a nice luxurious but expensive treat. For me, a nice reward to look forward to eat at the end of a typical crazy Vegas trip! Next up, actually eating at Bouchon the restaurant itself!",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,4
Give me one of everything! Every time I come here I end up going home with way too many baked goods and everything is stellar. I haven't tried one thing that I wouldn't buy again. I've custom ordered birthday cakes here as well as just picked out things from the bakery shelves. This place will not disappoint either way!,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Tried the milk soft serve with the corn flakes topping and some cookies. The milk soft serve for $6-7 is very expensive especially for the portion and you have to pay extra for any toppings. The customer service was the best part of my experience. The cookies i tried were the compost cookie, their most popular and the corn cookie. Corn cookie was weird. The compost cookie was okay. i thought the coffee flavor was too strong. Overall pricey desserts that were just okay to me.",unknown,Negative,Positive,unknown,3
"Great vibe, but the service sucked. Sunday night and there was only 1 person behind me. It was my first visit and the young girl was obviously in a rush. I ended up with the salted Carmel freeze. The ice cream was melting and runny. I will give it a try again, but my first visit wasn't impressive.",Positive,unknown,Negative,unknown,3
"DELICIOUS but too expensive for what it was to get full stars. I loved the options and I'm definitely happy I ordered the ice cream with the marshmallow and macaroon. However, I feel like the macaroons aren't as great as other macaroons I've had and for the price, I think each component should be delicious on its own. Again, I'm still super happy I tried this out and the marshmallow is a MUST!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"In a word, ""meh"". Had the lobster tail, chocolate canoli and a cookie. The cookie tasted like it was a day old. The canoli was hard and tasteless. And the lobster tail was runny and lackluster. The staff was also unemotional, and stale. I'm a big fan of Next Great Baker but this was a huge disappointment. I feel like Buddy would be ashamed of this place.",unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,1
"Amelie's was decent but not worth the price or wait in line in my opinion. I went with my girlfriend, her mom, and my mom and was able to try a few different pastries. The salted caramel brownie was good. I really liked the brownie, and the caramel topping was okay although not really my thing. For $2.50 though, I would expect more than the tiny 1 oz brownie you get. The eclairs were decent too. I didn't really like the pastry part, but the vanilla and chocolate custards were both pretty tasty. My girlfriend and her mom were both disappointed that it was a custard filling rather than cream but enjoyed them nonetheless. I had one bite of a piece of chocolate cake and it was pretty good as well, but not anything worth $5 for a cupcake sized piece. After waiting in line for 10 minutes (it was Saturday evening, I'll give them that) and seeing the really high prices for the portions, I assumed these desserts must be heaven, but everyone in my group agreed they were just decent and nothing more.",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,3

I consider myself a cannoli expert. Seeing the show on tv made me curious and I've wanted to try the baked goods from here for quite some time. The cannoli were some of the best I've had.

"I came here recently on a trip to Vegas and stopped by to check out the hype. I picked up a tin of 6 cookies as gifts ($17... $18 and change after tax) and also tried the fruity cereal milk soft serve topped with crushed corn flakes. The cereal milk soft serve tastes exactly like how you would expect it to. It was almost salty and not sweet at all. The salty taste probably came from the crushed corn flakes. Not a bad dessert, but definitely on the heavier side. I could go without this in the future. As for the cookies- tried 3: 1. Compost cookie- this cookie is a bit hard texturally and has a lot of interesting elements to it. Overall, tasted a lot like a toffee cookie to me with bits of pretzel. I give it 2-1/2 out of 5 stars. 2. Chocolate chip marshmallow cookie- 4/5- softer cookie and you definitely taste the corn flakes. I liked this one more than the compost. 3. Corn cookie- my fave and I can see why it's a cult classic. Would love to replicate this at home! 5/5! Tried a nibble of the crack pie and thought it was good but way too buttery and heavy!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,3
"Came here around 8:00 on a Saturday, didn't have to wait long whatsoever, however when we were leaving around 9 the line was quite long. Lots of parking available, small place with good amounts outdoor seating, awesome chill staff. They are more than happy to have you try every flavor. I loved each one I tried- taro, captain crunch and havla. Ultimately went with the amazing marzipan and graham cracker soft swerve. Will definitely be back!",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5

"I was really excited to visit this famous Charlotte patisserie not only because everyone was raving about the their delicious tarts, croissants, & eclairs, but also because it's open ALL THE TIME (24hrs/day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year) and they are welcoming of all kinds of people to hangout, read, study. First off, the good: - Salted Caramel Brownie (5 stars): the PERFECT contrast of smooth sweet/salty caramel atop a thin but dense (and slightly crunchy) chocolate brownie. You must try this if you love either caramel or brownies! - Their creme brÃ»lÃ©e was delicious, and the fact that they flambÃ©/torch it only when ordered so it's warm, fresh, and crispy was a nice touch. - Finally, the chocolate eclair and mixed-berry tart were both very decent and I'd happily order them again. The only downside is that it was abundantly clear that those long hours really diminished the quality of at least 2 of their items: - The croissant: I had already ordered a few items so I wasn't planning to get anything else, but I'm a sucker for a great croissant and the lady at the counter said it was fresh baked that morning, so I happily ordered it expecting a soft, flaky, buttery snack. Unfortunately what I got was hard and dry; honestly, I've had day old croissants taste fresher than this! I have no doubt that if it were fresh out of the oven it would have been amazing, but someone definitely wasn't keeping track of how old/dry these were. - The sticky-bun (mini cinnamon roll + raisins & extra sugar glaze on top): it also was was disappointingly ""aged"" liked the croissant, and although I've got a notorious sweet tooth, this tasted way too sugary too me. Overall, I'd definitely come back for their delicious snacks/desserts that are not too perishable and to try their famous macaroons. As for the disappointing croissant, I'd be willing to try it again if I KNEW it was fresh, but otherwise skip it.",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,3
Yum! Every time we come to old town Vegas there is a line out the door for this donut shop so I knew today would be a good day to come and try it as I had a little time to spare. Everyone here is super nice and they open fairly early however they're open until they sell out so if there's something that you're looking for and get there early and stand in line. Yes if you have butter and jelly and Oreo doughnut both were excellent.,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"I came here for the Yelp Elite event Sunday evening. They closed the place just for us, and you could feel the tension in the air as the ""regular schmegular"" people walked up smiling, only to walk away in disgust. Oh well... I don't know if it was the fact that we were excited to try the ice cream, or that I'm sure many of us were having dessert BEFORE dinner! That NEVER happens in my world, but we all descended upon the place at once and the line was out of the door. Unfortunately, the weather did not care that we were standing outside because the rain began to pour down on us and we had to move our party inside. If you know anything about this place, it is small. So it became uncomfortable rather quickly, but as for me, I kept busy talking with a new friend from Florida and trying to narrow down my three top choices. I thought I was being proactive when I went online to look at the flavors and decide then, but the flavors were different. Just like many of the other ice cream shops, you are allowed to taste flavors before making a commitment. I tried the goat cheese with cherries and sweet corn with blackberries. In the end, I decided on the Gooey Butter cake first in the cone, followed by cream puff, and topped with goat cheese with red cherries. {Insert long, deep sigh here!} First of all, the flavors were strategically placed in the cone in a specific order because I had a feeling about that butter cake...everyone raved about it and whatever flavor is at the bottom of the cone, you get to enjoy most. See what I did there?!?! Let me just say that I live in the University City area and I would have zero problems driving over just for ice cream. On that note, go get some, it's totally worth it.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"I've been to Bouchon bakery in Yountville and the one at the Venetian casino pales in comparison. We ordered an epi bead which was stale, we ordered the chocolate bouchons which were dry and 2 cinnamon rolls which were also very dry. I don't know if these pastries were old but it is not even close to the scale of deliciousness of the food you get from Yountville. I hope they do something to fix this becasue it would be ashame to have such a fantastic bakery become mediocre.",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,2
"This is a small, possibly difficult place to find, ice cream shop especially if you don't know the neighborhood. It is located in the back of a small commercial building. They are known for their marshmallow and macaroon toppings but we just got a small cup with 3 flavors. The peanut butter was very peanutty and delicious and the Irish Cream definitely meets expectations. The chocolate chip, although good, could certainly use more chips. Our only disappointment was with having such a the wide variety of flavors they didn't have chocolate. We asked but the girl behind the counter wasn't very talkative and really didn't respond she just smiled. But it is a great place to go for a homemade ice cream fix.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"Macarons are fan-freaking-tastic! Wish I'd gotten the pain au chocolat fresh, but it was delish nonetheless. I don't know if it was because I ate it the next day, but the PB&J brioche was a tad dry.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"5 stars for the pastries, but 3 for the espresso. I love Americanos so I know when my coffee isn't made right. I think they need to up the shots of espresso, because my drink tasted like water. The Strawberry Cheese bread we ate was tasty though!!! I also LOVE the misugaru latte! Will be back for those but probably not the coffee.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
This was my first time trying SomiSomi as this new location opened up right by my house. It's amazing!! The taiyaki was so good. We tried the cheddar and custard and both were amazing. The ah-boong was also one of the best desserts I've ever had. The taiyaki waffle is so flaky on the outside but doughy and soft inside. It goes so well with the ice cream!! I can't wait to go back!!!,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Omigawd...I think I've become an addict. A Jack Frost donut addict. I've become said addict after only a few days of snacking on donut carnage that amounted from a box of mixed dozen Jack Frost Donuts. It really wasn't my idea. You see, my brother, sister-in-law and baby niece picked me up from CLE and immediately drove to Jack Frost to get some goodies for the weekend visit. We all maintain that it was my 4-week old niece's idea. Smart girl. When we rolled into the donut shack (because truly that's what it looks like), I was awestruck by the number of sugary confections...awaiting my thighs' demise. Damn, those are some amazing donuts. Grab yourself a 10 spot (cash only) and choose a dozen options. You'll have to ask the employee behind the counter to identify each variety, but it's cool. It's part of the experience. A few donuts you can't miss: -Regular glazed (*perfection*) -Sour cream -Sour cream blueberry -Strawberry cheesecake -Apple cinnamon (warm it up! you're welcome) -Toasted coconut (they were out of this one when I visited, but everyone raves about it) I love you, Jack Frost.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5

"I discovered this place when I was in Vegas, craving macarons. My first visit in early June was filled with surprise, the macaron were twice the size of a regular macaron! And, when I took my first bite, I fell in love. The macaron was crispy yet airy on the inside, and chewy filled with delicious cream in the middle. The macaron was absolutely perfect, and I had no complaints about it. However, when I visited Bouchon again this week, I was disappointed in the size of the macarons. Their macaron size now is very inconsistent, some were larger than others, and overall, the macarons had shrunk. When I ordered a box back in June, all the macarons were in perfect uniformity. Now, some were small, while other flavors were larger. I also tried the turkey sandwich, and fell in love. The bread has cranberries/raisins, and when toasted, it was a perfect complement to the turkey and brie cheese. I got this sandwich every morning and am still not sick of it. I plan on trying the other pastries when I visit Las Vegas again, but I hope that the macarons will not disappoint. Thank goodness the macarons still taste the same...",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4

"I called on Thursday 4/14/2016 business was closed for day. But, manager Joe answer phone called. I was excited was able to speak to someone.. I placed a order for a birthday party of 23rd of April. I was told I would get a call back to confirm. .Well I've been calling them myself for 4 days straight. Seeing if order was place and will be ready for pick up on 23rd.. sent business emails.. all i have to say is Don't bother with this place!! Not reliable. . Rather take business else where..",unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,1
Thomas Keller is amazing. He really knows hospitality. Never leave here or the restaurant without an almond croissant.,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
Such a huge selection-hard to make a decision because it is ALL good!!! Love that they partner with other local businesses to source items for their menus like Nancy B's and Pastries ala carte. Is highly recommend trying Page's!!!,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"This place won my heart instantly just based on the crazy flavors they had available! Thankfully the staff were super friendly and helpful and allowed us to sample basically everything. Hubby took the last of the Lucky Charms and got it in milkshake form. Honestly, this ended up being my choice. The ice cream on its own was incredible. And somehow the milkshake retained that magical flavor and didn't taste watered down at all. I ended up with two generous scoops - one of coco puffs and one of birthday cake. They were both awesome, for sure. But that Lucky Charms is what really got me!",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Like this spot. I've had some shakes, ice cream sandwiches, and a vegetarian sandwich. All were ok just expensive. Id go here to splurge on some guilty pleasures.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"This is by far my favorite ice cream shop is Pittsburgh. There is such a variety to choose from and it is GOOD! A strawberry sundae with whipped cream (fresh, from a whipped cream machine!!!) and nuts is my personal favorite. The freckled lemonade is also a must-try! This place has become a summer tradition for my family and we have never been disappointed. They make smaller sized cones for my kids and will make any custom requests that we have. Parking can be a challenge, but we always find a way! There is only one bench seat along the side and there are milk crates in the back that can double as seats. I think the lack of seating is actually good because people don't linger as long and it keeps the traffic flowing. It is cash only, but an ATM is located at the side of the building.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"I was SO happy with my ice cream experience here. Their waffle cones are amazing (and probably nothing like you've had before) and their array of ice cream (and sherbets) is wonderful. They have the classics but also have some interesting choices: salsa ice cream, cucumber, and nutella. You guys, it's so good. Just go here. Go here now.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Buddy's baked goods are not overrated. I wanted to sample everything!! I visited Carlo's twice during my trip. The 2nd time especially I got greedy, ordered too many items, ate them all, couldn't stop. SO GOOD.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
Nice treat. They are doing something no one else is doing. Worth a visit or two. Usually a line due to popularity.,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"I've been going to this little ice cream shop since I was in high school and it has been one of my favorite spots to go visit with my friends. I'm never disappointed with any of their ice cream selections they offer and the staff is fantastic! I always recommend their strawberry ice cream, it's legitimately the best I've ever had.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
Flavorful & generous serving sizes! I ordered a junior size of the seasonal Key lime pie flavor. So good! Complete with chunks of pie crust. The cone is given in a cup so it can easily be shared with someone. Outdoor seating at benches are available and a small parking lot. No restrooms. Worth a visit on a trip to CLE!,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
Easy to park. Large parking lot next to building. Nice atmosphere inside. You can dine in or get takeout. You can get coffee drinks. I was just disappointed with the selections. I was expecting more choices and varieties of cakes. The presentation and flavors were underwhelming. Perhaps it was just the day we went.,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,3
"Beyond disappointing. Went here the second day after they opened at 10 am there doors were shut. Went again an hour later the doors were still shut. Went to concierge and they called them and they lied to concierge saying they've been open since 10. We came back today 1/7/17 a few days. We ordered the deal sampler thing, a coffee milk shake, and the birthday quake. We were trying to get a quick treat before having to walk over to bellagio for o and wanted to get free parking at cosmo while it lasted. We had 45 min, which we thought was plenty of time. No one was in line and 3 shakes were ordered before us (they obviously got there things before us and we saw). There had to be about 7-10 people on staff there. Only 1 person was making orders, everyone else was chatting in front of the register while this poor girl is struggling to make these orders. We were given the cookies and truffles and pie at the register so we had those but had to wait 25 minutes to get our milk shake and quake. Then had to remind them to give us our soft serve which they made ever so slowly. it was ice cream and cornflakes. We weren't sure why it took so long but we went with it. The compost cookie was terrible. I like pretzels and stuff, but it just tried too hard. The crack pie is def overrated. I would prefer the pecans. The lady described it like a pecan pie without pecans, I wasn't paying attention so i got excited for pecans to realize she said without them. that's my b,. The birthday truffle was too sweet for me. The birthday quake had an off taste that i wasn't a fan of and the coffee milkshake wasn't sweet enough oddly. We then were out 60 bucks and didn't like anything. So we went back with the milk shake hopping they would remake us something else. We asked what they recommended and we got a chocolate shake. Can't go wrong with that. We then realized we jinxed it. It was bitter and not sweet, so we tossed it in a garbage and left. I love the cosmo hotel, but there not putting good things in place of the old, and the prices are just highway robbery. I don't see this location lasting and go there with no expectations that way you might enjoy overpriced desserts, or just go to sweet raku!",unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,1
A Charlotte ice cream staple and a must go to stop for ice cream! Jeni's has tons of unique flavors that you can't find in your typical grocery store! Today I tried the Whiskey and Pecan flavor for the first time and I loved it!!! The whiskey flavor was subtle and added the perfect touch to the ice cream!,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"I heard about Sweet Republic being on a top ice cream list, so naturally I was so excited to try it. I love artisanal crafted ice cream, definitely preferred over Baskin Robbins or Cold Stone. I went on a hot summer day, and even though there was a line, it wasn't too bad. The servers are all very friendly and I got to try many of their flavors. I loved the salted butter caramel and the sweet corn. I'm excited to try the next season's flavors!! I was not disappointed by any of them and agreed that the ice cream was certainly some of the best! They have a nice sitting area equipped with board games and cards. Very clean and inviting! This is by far my new favorite ice cream shop in Arizona! :)",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"We are a fan of the show and have always wanted to go to their main store, but when my daughter and I heard about the shop on the strip we had to go. Their selection is not large, but what they do have is very good. My daughter and go the lobster tails and HOLY COW they were amazing. The next day (Sunday) we arrived early so we could get some goodies for the family, but they did not have any Cannolis. We got some more lobster tails, biscotti and White Chocolate Mouse Cake. My wife was very happy with the cake and my other daughter was disappointed they did not have any Connolis, but was very happy with the lobster tail.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"This is ice cream at its best. You can tell that this comes from homemade recipes and you can tell that it's fresh and just delicious. The scoops are very generous so one scoop, in a cup or in a waffle bowl, is a lot bigger than I would expect. I got the black cherry scoop of ice cream in a waffle bowl. The ice cream was the best I have ever had for black cherry ice cream, no contest. The waffle bowl is freshly made on the premises and it was absolutely yummy. My friend got the bananas Foster ice cream and was pretty much in heaven. We got our son the chocoholic ice cream and it was amazing as well. We got lucky when we got there because there were only two people ahead of us. The lines tend to get long at times. We initially saw this place in California and the line to get the ice cream was around the building so we were excited to find one near us in Las Vegas. When we started ordering our ice cream, we noticed at least 20 people behind us. This is no surprise because the quality of the ice cream and the cones are incredible. The prices are right and I highly recommend it. We are definitely going back.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"The atmosphere alone is worth 4 stars for me. And the croissant was good enough for me to keep trying with the food. What I loved - the atmosphere, the staff, the coffee (please, will the people who are falling to pieces about no skim or 2% just go to Starbucks and stop taking up space and breathing my full-fat air), my ham and cheese breakfast croissant, the mini-fruit tart. What I liked - the salted caramel brownie, which in no way resembles a brownie, but is very sweet and satisfying. I still have a small chocolate mousse waiting for sampling, and am just gonna give it the benefit of the doubt. What I didn't like - the rest of the pastry selection I sampled really suffered (but I'm a fighter, and I am gonna keep trying!!). The cream puff was several days old, it might have been better had in made recently but the one I had was quite stale. The same problem with the cherry turnover, I think this would be very nice if it had been fresh. But I won't order this one again. The chocolate croissant was just unfortunate. Whomever had made the croissant, or maybe served it, had been working with asiago cheese previously. So my chocolate croissant had a very distinct asiago cheese flavor - not good, not good at all. We were there at 9:00 on a Sunday - i would expect Saturday to be the biggest baking day, so maybe we were there early enough that they were clearing out the old stuff before stocking the newly baked goods. But all in all, I am coming back, Jack, to do it again...",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"The staff are quick and efficient. The shop is cute. The fondant skills for the cake are amazing. HOWEVER, everything may look delicious, but it won't taste it. We waited in line for about 25 minutes and was truly disappointed. We got: One yellow cupcake with buttercream - cake was dry and frosting was flavorless. One cream puff - The cream inside was once again flavorless and tasted like overcooked eggs. The pastry part was not flakey at all. One cup of strawberry shortcake - Besides the strawberry, I toss the cup away. The cake was once again dry and the whipped cream was flat. A sprinkle cookie - It was okay. Nothing worth the half hour wait. We tossed most of the items away, since it so bland. If you're going to eat something bad for your health, every bite better be worth it! This was not worth it. It's also overpriced and overcrowded, yet sadly the pastries are underachieved.",Positive,Negative,Positive,unknown,2
"Are you kidding me? Where has this place been all my life? While visiting Cleveland for the weekend, my son and I decided to trek downtown so check out its 'renaissance' and we weren't disappointed. We decided to catch the sunset and city view from Edgewater Park and then opted to have dessert before heading back to the hotel. A quick search of the area suggested Mitchell's so we headed over. Love the area it's in (Market Square, near as I can tell) and the marquis out front. From the street, you can easily see you're in for a treat as it's bright, open and airy; an old-school ice cream parlor feel but with a modern vibe. Fortunately there was a small, but fast moving line when we entered. Being novices, we were happy to find a menu near the door so we could be prepared when we hit the counter (Seinfeld 'Soup Nazi' episode came to mind). Instead, the staff was all so happy and helpful and we decided on a waffle cone with a scoop of salted caramel and Mint chip. Yum Yum and Yum again. We discovered my son doesn't care for the former but we both the loved the latter. So creamy, perfectly minted and with magical chunks of chocolate. I found pricing reasonable at $6.50 for the portion size. The creamery is set up pretty neat with a large window behind the counter though which you can watch the kitchen in action (it was late so there wasn't much going at the time) but it's worth the trip upstairs for the birds eye view. I can't imagine going anywhere else for ice cream while in Cleveland. And from what I could tell, their flavors rotate and there are alway plenty of choices. Don't miss this spot!!",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"ooooooooo how delicious their cupcakes were!!!!!!! This place has a variety of choices for cupcakes and it is so worth to try it out! The promenade one even has a little cupcake ATM right outside of it in case you miss their operating hours or the line for the store is crowded for you. It only takes credit card, but during their hours you can go inside and go into the cupcake or ice cream area. They had plenty of people working the Sprinkles shop and didn't laugh when I went in the wrong area initially lol. I had the chocolate chip cookie cupcake and my mom had the coconut cupcake! The presentation in itself is marvelous and the way they package their items are so nice! And lastly, we loved the taste of the ones we got and almost snagged another available at the McCarran airport before we left for Cleveland. All I want to say now is, SPRINKLES EXPAND TO CLEVELAND PLEASE IF YOU ALREADY HAVEN'T BECAUSE I'D BUY MANY, MANY, MANY MORE OF YOUR YUMMY CUPCAKES!!!!!",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5

"You know what's better than carbs and fats? Nothing. This is what you do on a lazy Sunday afternoon after a long drive. Stop at Batch, pick up some baked goodness, eat, then wander around in the sun (attempting) to work off all that you inhaled. I had the plain croissant as well as a pain au fromage. Delicious. Perfectly baked. Perfectly flakey yet soft. The croissant had the right amount of ""bite"" to it. I have no negative comments about taste, staff, decor. I am glad they were able to move into a bigger location in the same neighborhood, though I do miss the smaller more intimate feel as now it has more of a mass-market kitchen feel to it. We were greeted when we walked in and quickly asked how they could help us. Help me? The only way one can help me in a bakery is by kindly pointing me in the direction of the door so I don't inhale the entire place.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Honestly I had their cakes and crack pie. Have not been to the actual store but was given their Birthday Cake and Crack Pie. Birthday Cake could be a little bit ""too sweet"" for some but to me it was more rich than sweet. The Crack PIe is the business. If you freeze it it's even better. Again very rich and flavorful and a cross between pecan pie and peanut brittle (without the nuts) but it's one of those things where the whole pie is in front of you and 10 mins later you look down and nothing is there cause your fat ass ate the whole damn thing without realizing it. It's that good imo. Will def go to the store to try other items like the Cookies and Cereal Milk.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Great little place but it's not a place to hang out as there's no inside seating. There's a few benches and grassy area, but the storefront is located at the entrance of the strip mall. There's 100's of flavors to choose from, and they even have flavors of the month. You can ask for a sample, especially for those with vague descriptions like Graham Central Station. Prices aren't cheap, about $3.50 for a scoop. It was a nice scoop, and you can even say a generous scoop, but its still one scoop of ice cream. Was it the best ice cream I've ever had? Hmm, not sure. It was good, and it hit the spot on a warm Memorial Day evening.",Negative,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"I scream, folks screamed, we all screamed for this ice cream shop. Sorry I don't have a photo, I was too busy chowing down! I got the raspberry chocolate chunk. Man- it was delicious. My husband said he didn't want any, once he saw he was busy talkin' and I was busy eatin' , he changed his tune. The shop is quaint and fun. Full of candy and ice cream flavors. The ice cream was creamy and cold. It held its texture - I detest a drippy ice cream. You can either enjoy it in a cone or cup, I chose a cup and it was well worth the cost.",Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,4

"Excited that they opened a Ghirardelli store back in Vegas again. Came here on the weekend for 1 mission and that was to get their 50 pc ct of dark peppermint bark. I was a bit bummed that they didn't have the sale price like the online store did but oh well. I definitely want to come back and try their dessert. As for the location, it really sucks if you park at The Quad or Flamingo. Next time I come back, I would probably park at Mirage or Caesars palace and walk across. Saves you from spending more than half an hour trying to find a space like I did.",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,5
"Milk Bar is one of my favorite go to spots when I'm back home in NYC so I was very happy when I found that there was a full location in Las Vegas. I had my usual the first visit, cereal ice cream with corn flakes dusted on the sides, the second time around I had the cereal milk latte which was basically my two favorite food items combined. The service here was quick and easy and the young lady who took my order was quick to have my ice cream served to me before I could finish even signing my receipt, just an awesome experience with good dessert, can't wait to go back.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"When Fatty Daddy's opened up, this place was really great. The main attractions were the Fatty Daddy or Mini Daddy cookie cups, but the ambiance and staff were amazing too. We went in the other night after not visiting in awhile and things felt... off. Cookie cup? Is that the same thing we used to get? I thought there were two sizes. My friend orders a cookie cup, but they only give him half a cookie and a smaller portion of ice cream than normal. The girl behind the counter was friendly, but seemed a little nervous. We asked where the amazing Steve Urkel picture went, and the girl explained the business is under new ownership. This explains everything. Even the POS system is different, and doesn't offer rewards or incentives. I even got a flier for Fatty Daddy's this week advertising ""Coffee, pastries, and ice cream, Relax, refresh, recharge!"" It's an ice cream spot, not a day spa. Say ""Ice cream, coffee, pastries"" at least- your name has the word Fatty in it... priorities people. Anyway. This spot is worth looking for and worth the trip. The ice cream flavors are a solid mix of classics and unique blends. If you've never been here before, you won't know the difference and it'll probably be a 5 star place for you. But I feel new management may have cut out some of the charm and is trying to skimp on things that made us come back for more.",Negative,unknown,Negative,unknown,1

"This place is just ok at best. I've had Sprinkles cupcakes before and wasn't crazy about them, but I wanted to try their ice cream anyway. I opted for a scoop of their salted caramel ice cream in a cup. I was warned by the guy at the counter that it was very salty. I asked for a taste and did find it on the salty side, so I asked for caramel sauce to make it sweeter and more caramel-y. The ice cream was ok - not terrible but not among the best I've had either. As for the caramel sauce, it was on the runnier side and I prefer it thick and more flavorful. There is plenty of seating outside but it was just too hot to sit out there on the day we went. Luckily there was counter seating on the cupcake side of the shop. (Ice cream is to the right when you enter; cupcakes to the left.) We had to wipe the counter top though - there were crumbs galore on it. It made no sense to me that they had a bunch of workers waiting to help on the cupcake side (most were not helping customers as there was a lull in foot traffic) and not one of them could wipe down the counter top. We returned later in the day with a friend who wanted to try their cupcake ATM, but it was out of service. This is one of those places where I can say that I'm glad that I tried it, but I don't feel the need to come back.",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,2
Could not wait to go for my birthday & drove an hour to come but they wouldn't allow my boys who are 14 & 16 come in with me so we had to leave. Their business their decision. Just a warning to all would want to go because the sign says children are allowed with parent but when we entered we were told if over 11 they have to come in by themselves.,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,1

"I stopped by Scooptopia by chance while I was in the area. The Yelp photos of the Halo Halo looked too tempting. If I'm going to be honest, it was my first time ever having one, so I'm not sure if my opinion counts, but I'd have to say it was absolutely delicious. I'm a big fan of shaved ice and have been seeing many different cultural versions of it. This Filipino version, while not served with shaved ice (I think it's crushed), was filled with a variety of ingredients. It had ube ice cream, sweet beans, coconut, sago, flan (which idk if it was homemade but it was soooo good), and much more. I wish they had a location in Chandler, but for now, if I'm in the area again, I'll make a stop!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5

"I have a sweet tooth that doesn't really need satisfying all that often. I just recently was turned on to this jewel of a bakery a few weeks ago. Now, it's like a little voice in the back of my head if I'm out....""hmm....a little something sweet from Amelie's would hit the spot"". Never had anything there that didn't nearly make my eyes roll into the back of my head. It's all good to me....seriously. I've never been to the Uptown location so I can't compare but I love the eclectic nature of this joint. Very cool and the vibe is just chill and laid back. Fits me perfect. The whole NoDa area is great and this place compliments it very well. In short, I have created an affair with Amelie's that is surely something sinful yet satisfying and one to last a very long time I can tell :)",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5

And money is nothing for the price of some Good treats. I got back to my room and it was horrible! No flavor, the cupcakes were dry and tasted like plain cream cheese in the icing and super soggy crust in everything else. I haven't been so disappointed in a while. I wouldn't waste my money!",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,1

"It was my final morning before check out and I didn't want to do the buffet breakfast at the Grand Lux Cafe again. And so since the Bouchon Bakery was just near the lifts to the rooms, I thought I'd nip right downstairs for a quick pastry and hot tea for myself and my friend. Oh boy, it was 9am and there was already a long line waiting to place orders. Thank goodness they have a system of taking orders while you're in line so that you get your order and pay for it by the time you get to the cashier around the corner. Unfortunately, as I found out, when you place your order from around the corner, unless you already know what's being displayed at the front of the counter, you will only have seen the several awesomely delicious looking pastries on display......and likely have missed everything else at the front counter display around the corner. There were a few more items such as cookies, breakfast croissant and French baguette sandwiches, yoghurt, mixed fruit cups, etc. Yea, I could've added the items to my order, but it was so busy and I didn't want to get dirty looks from the customers in line behind me....plus everybody behind he counter was so busy that I didn't want to bother them......plus, I had already ordered more than enough. I ordered one raisin danish (ok, they called it something raisin in French, but I forget the name and spelling) and a blueberry muffin. Yes, they were both totally fresh and yummy! However, the raisin pastry I thought was a bit thin so you don't get the full usual fluffiness of the inside.....the outer crisp was nice and light though. The blueberry muffin was very good too....and both not as sweet as I thought they'd be, which I was glad about.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"10/10 bakery, vibes, food and service. I came here on a Monday during the day and it was very relaxing and not too busy. The service was amazing, I was stuck between what pastry to get and the woman patiently walked me through her favorites and helped me choose one. I ended up getting the espresso entrement (see pictures) which she recommended and it was delicious! It also looked so cool as a bubble kind of pastry and seemed too pretty to eat. The inside was huge, it had a lot of seating and the decor was nice to look at. I worked from here and it had a nice and relaxing vibe, definitely recommend checking it out!",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5

So you can make your own bowl here meaning you pick your 2 flavors of gelato, your choice of macaroon, one topping, and they add on a fired roasted marshmallow on top. They had some AWESOME gelato flavors. I had the chocolate malt and the mango habanero. Let me jus say... Ive had ice cream with a kick before, but nothing like this mango habanero. It was SPICY, and I got the malt flavor (which was amazing) to neutralize it essentially. They obviously don't compliment each other, but the malt was good to switch to when my tongue needed a break from the habanero. Anyway, this place is a 4/5 and not a 5/5 because I just didn't feel like the macaroons were fresh or that good. I asked for the red velvet macaroon and I wasn't sure if they accidentally gave me the strawberry one. Regardless, it was alright. I think the macaroons overall here are underwhelming. The ice cream total was around $7 which I was OK with for the experience. Anyway, for the 'gram this place is great. And for kids! If you want an exotic, crazy colored macaroon like you see in some of the Yelp photos, they may not have those/didn't when we went. By the way, they do also have bubble tea! I didn't try any when I went, but there were some limited options on the menu. There are a few tables and it was pretty empty when we went on a Friday night! It may be that they get more traffic earlier in the day.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
Best ice cream I've ever had. It's so fresh and soft and the flavors are unique. The lavender honey is my new favorite.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"I love that the crepes my husband and I enjoyed were made fresh, and that the ingredients were fresh as well. The lemon curd in my crepe was bursting with zest and was not too sweet. The strawberries in my husband's crepe were ripe and blended wonderfully with the dark chocolate that he selected. Only thing I didn't like was the location of this place. People were bumping into us trying to get around, and it seemed chaotic.",Negative,Positive,unknown,Negative,4
"This place is GORGEOUS ! I L-O-V-E the decor and the vibe. I love that you can bring your laptop here and just nestle into a small corner or open area of the Bakery, plug laptop in, put headphones on and just cast all the noise away. This place is HUGE and you really can spread out as much as you want. The service was OK - perhaps it was a busy day but I think it could have been improved. Reason One - Minus five star. I ordered a bunch of stuff w/ coffee but the one thing i remember the most were the macaroons. They were not great, perhaps they were out from early morning? To be fair, I was there around 2PM-ish. They were just rock HARD. The coffee was ok, but Coffee in Charlotte overall is OK. Reason Two - minus five star ( hard macaroons). I will definitely return but perhaps at an earlier time.",Positive,Negative,Negative,Positive,4
"Found Fatty Daddy's on Yelp! after noticing all the great reviews. I have to say, we were not disappointed! The girl behind the counter (I'm sorry, I forgot her name) was super friendly, extremely helpful and really took the time to explain everything and offer samples. Per her suggestion, I opted for the chocolate/coconut mix that tastes just like an Almond Joy (her creation) with an almond macaroon. I asked her to please toast my marshmallow until it was nice and crispy and she was more than happy to oblige. Overall, it was a wonderful experience, both the food and service were outstanding. Thank you!!",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"It's beautiful in this tiny little cozy ice cream shop with no where to sit!! The employees are rude and I can't even tell you if the ice cream is good. After spending 20 minutes at 11 am on a Monday waiting for ice cream in this Claustrophobic box we just left. There were not many ppl in there shopping; us and another group of ppl. I don't know what the hold up was and I don't know why no-one even said hey ""I'll be with you in a few"". We literally stood at the counter the entire time. They are hella slow, lack personality we didn't feel comfortable or welcomed. There's a lot of deserts to choose from, but again not sure how anything tastes because they are not customer service friendly.",Negative,unknown,Negative,unknown,2
"This is a decent bakery, above average. However, since it carries Thomas Keller's name as an offshoot of Bouchon Bistro, which is an excellent spot for a meal, it doesn't quite measure up. The turkey sandwich comes with cheddar(?), onion, and watercress on pecan bread. It was ok - you can tell the ingredients are good - but the sandwich itself wasn't outstanding. Most of the items seem to just miss the mark: the bacon(?), egg, and cheese croissant comes with a beautiful, fat slice of omelet but it's topped with a thin sliver of cheese; the Cobb salad is huge but bacon wasn't listed as an ingredient so I passed on that. The macarons are a nice size, great for splitting with a friend, and the croissants are buttery without feeling greasy. I'll be back for that Kouign Amann.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,3
"If you are staying at the Venetian then a trip to the Bouchon Bakery is a must. As others have mentioned it's tucked away under an escalator near the main elevator banks for the hotel. Another has opened on the street between the Venetian and Palazzo on the Venetian side. The ham and cheese on french bread grilled with mustard is pretty tasty as a lunch option. Mango yogurt is nice for breakfast, be warned definitely on the sweet side. The baked goods, like croissants are great as is their coffee.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"Against the warning of a close friend, we decided to try Mary Coyle's tonight. The place was busy & the staff (3 young people and an older man) seemed very disorganized. We weren't offered samples & weren't acknowledged by the person running the register until we asked if we could order. Ice cream was only ""o.k"" - I doubt they make it in house. My boyfriend ordered a chocolate malt & received a vanilla one. If you decide to try it out (which I would advise against with so many better ice cream or gelato shops in the valley) ask for it ""to go"" as seating is limited.",Negative,Negative,Negative,unknown,1
"This ice cream place is a cute store! Has so many toys and interesting things. I like the interior design in the store. The Vietnamese coffee tastes pretty good. But I ended up getting the strawberry ice cream. Their ice cream is really creamy and soft. Also, their scoops are so big! I couldn't finish one by myself. They had extra seating outside in the back with the water misters going on so that was nice. I was scared I was going to eat my ice cream in the heat because there is no inside seating. Only one thing I didn't like is how the ice cream was melting really quick. Its probably from the combination of the door being kept open and people were really crowded in that store. I also don't see why people like this place so much. It's okay. Nothing special to it just regular ice cream but I just went to try to say that I have gone there before.",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,3
"What an awesome ice cream eatery! Had the Mini Daddy cookie cup with mango and passion fruit sorbet, and topped it off with an almond macaroon. All cookie cups come with a toasted marshmallow. It was delicious! My husband had a Nutella and Java milkshake, and really enjoyed his drink as well. The interior was clean and super cute. This 80s baby loved the Steve Urkel painting on the wall. Jackson 5 songs were playing over the speakers, so it was a fun throwback atmosphere. The server who helped us was very polite, and encouraged us to try all their fun flavors, like the Urkel (chocolate and peanut butter) and Netflix and Chill (vanilla with popcorn and chocolate candy). Check in on Yelp and get 10% off! Great deal. Will be back again!",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"A little hard to find through Google maps but worth the trip! The chocolate almond croissant was a bit hard, but the flavor was spot on. The fruit danish was also a hit and my mom loved the cream.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
This place is absolutely Amazing and the food was incredible. We'll def be adding this to our routine.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Overhyped and underwhelming. Unlike other yelpers, the line wasn't terribly long and moved quickly. They had a plethora of options to choose from, all of which looked good. However, the cupcakes themselves were disappointing. The cake was relatively dry and lacked flavor. At nearly $5 a piece, I've experienced better at most other bakeries selling for the same price. This place is busy and popular due to the TV show. Otherwise, this place would be a bakery to skip over when looking for dessert on the strip.",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,2
Sells novelties like a PG-13 girls-branded Spencer's. Cool chandeliers. Large scoop selection. Only one flavor soft serve though,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,4
Excellent place. A lot of variety. I wish I could afford everything on display. Definitely will be back. Just need to make sure I save before returning since I want to make sure I try more than one dessert.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"I wish I can eat there every morning. Very delicious pastries and sandwiches, good espresso drinks. Has outside sitting.",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
Went here on Friday specifically for the Pronuts. I was pretty happy with the PB&J and the Pumkin Cinnamon. The red velvet was definitely a hold over or something because it was dry as heck. BUT I will definitely go back and buy the lot so I can sample all the flavors available. I did the best I could with a few nutritional facts I found online for calorie and macro tracking. Only thing that would have made a better trip would have been nutrition facts on site. The service was great also. Pleasant and patient staff is appreciated.,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"Mason's made me an ice cream snob..that's for sure! No other ice cream spot in CLE can even compare. The flavor choices are AMAZING. Every time you go you have to try something new! My personal favs are probably the popcorn flavor, Rice Krispie, ugh what am I kidding..each one I have tried has been a fav! Don't go there expecting your run of the mill ice cream flavors...go outside your box and try something new! They are also SUPER dog friendly and even give your furry bud a pup cup! And also do yourself a favor and get a waffle cone!",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Saw the hype about this place opening and finely took my grandkids. Got there just after 11am so no line. Took sometime for service as he was in back. Got are orders in a timely manner. Now they have no indoor area to sit so that leaves just a couple of benches outside ( no tables ) as many of the other places in town have. If you have little ones I would get it to go. Their ice cream was ok but not worth the drive as I noticed on their signage. Next time I feel like ice cream or custard and need to drive with no place to sit I'll go to my favorite place ""luv it custard"" at LV Blvd and Oakey.",Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,2
"Won't be going back to sweet republic ever again! Don't get be wrong, the ice cream is delicious! I arrived at 1150am not realizing they don't open until noon. That certainly isn't their fault. However it is 104 degrees outside and I had my 3 month old baby with me. One of the employees came to the door at 1155am and opened it! I was so relieved they were going to let me in out of the heat. However, he wasn't opening the door for me, he was leaving. Shut the door, and locked it as he said ""sorry"" and walked away! I can take my $8 elsewhere!",Negative,Positive,Negative,unknown,1
Yummy yummy yummy! We waited outside for about 15 minutes in line. There is no seating inside unless you're probably eating at the Windsor. You can even try samples which is awesome. Got the kids scoop butter pecan and it is BOMB!!!,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"First, the owner Brandon was an awesome guy! He went over his ice creams and his vision for the shop. He asked about us and once he found out that we were from out of town he talked to us about our time here. He alone made the experience awesome...and then there was the ice cream! I loved the Cookie Monster and my wife loved the Lavender. I got the Cookie Monster doughnut and my wife got the Cookie monsters and lavender doughnut and OH MY GOODNESS! It was perfect! I could definitely have one every day! Every time I come back to Arizona this would be my first stop!",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Came here to just get a cookie, which I did :). But my friends all get something different and I gotta say yum. The ice cream sandwich with the cookies was awesome!!! The yogurt or ice cream was great too. I had a chocolate chip cookie and a glass of milk. Milk was milk but the cookie was great. Ill def be back to try other things and they also have a lot of old school cans y unused to eat when I was younger. I never really see them at stores anymore. Also the place is clean and the bathrooms are nice. Nice place to sit in the back by all the hipster bikes. Valet is free which is nice but I wish we could just park ourselves. That's why they lost a star with me.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
this place was on my list..read about this place on fb newsfeeds..tried the cereal milk soft serve ice cream...crushed cornflakes sprinkled around vanilla soft serve in a cup..yummy! and i tried a slice of the crack pie..omg it was damn delicious! wish i bought more to take back home...i will definitely be back!!!,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Quaint little donut shop starring astonishingly flavorful donuts, paired with a small variety of hot and iced coffees. French Toast donut comes with berry jelly, butter and what I thought to be real maple syrup! If it wasn't 100% maple, it sure was great quality! I don't know if it was the customer service or the high-quality ingredients that was the most impressionable! Those who love coffee will understand this next statement....It was a bad coffee weekend until I tried the Portland Roast at The Donut Bar! Starbucks couldn't even hold their own this weekend. Thank you to The Donut Bar for the exquisite flavors, genuine helpfulness and friendly experience. My favorite bar thus far!",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
This place is SO cute! We tried the ice cream- filled doughnuts. The homemade ice cream did not disappoint.,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"I loved the cereal milk soft serve! Like when I first heard of it I didn't know what to expect, but when I had it, it literally tasted like the milk you'd have right after you finish eating all the cereal in the bowl. Haha I was so happy because I haven't had that taste in my mouth for a while. It was the perfect amount of sweetness (not too sweet which was perfect, like I didn't want to throw it away I just kept going at it) and I bought it with the corn flakes, so the crunch added texture and made it so pleasant to eat! I'm craving this right now tbh, which is why it has taking me so long to give a review, Staff members were super informative and sweet when I was there. So at that time service was 5/5 :)",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
I had really high expectations after reading the other reviews. I've had the freshest of fresh macaroons and this was definitely not them. Very bummed! Was expecting fresh macaroons and croissants. Flavor was there which is why I at least rated 3 stars but far from freshly made!,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,3
This is your classic ice cream shop and one of the best in the Burgh! Even though it is only soft serve (all homemade with plenty of flavors) don't let that stop you from visiting. The menu is extensive with every kind of sundae and Arctic swirl combo you could imagine. The cookie crumb arctic swirl with Nancy B's chocolate chip cookies is one of my favorites. Also their fall menu with pumpkin ice cream is amazing! I highly recommend the pumpkin roll arctic swirl topped with a homemade pumpkin roll. The parking here is a bit tricky (gravel lot under a bridge) and no seating (outdoor counter only) but absolutely worth the stop and wait (can be long lines on the weekends).,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Decided to try this place again because there was no line. We got a chocolate cake donut and a Caramel Lobster Tail. The donut was dry as ****. The lobster tail would have been better if it wasn't so darn hard. It was difficult to even take a bite it was so hard. Had good flavor but I threw most of it out. $10 down the drain. Also, as we were waiting for our items to be bagged up we noticed that the kitchen was a disaster. Maybe they shouldn't have windows. Buddy, your restaurant is good but your bakery needs some serious improvement.",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,2
"Delicious ice cream between two soft cookies--whose idea was this? That genius is my new best friend! Churn reminds me of my childhood days of going to the corner ice cream shop on Sundays. This place is also filled with my favorite childhood candies! What's not to like. I would have given five stars, but this place is making me fat.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"Who doesn't want ice cream after enjoying great wine at Postino?! No one! You will feel happy waiting in line, it's worth it. I LOVE the custom made ice cream sandwiches. You can pick your cookie and ice cream flavor. It's big and yummy. My favorite is the mint chocolate chip ice cream. It's also great to be able to eat your treat in the garden behind the store. Not many tables, but people share and are friendly and everyone is happy! Recommended!",Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,5
"This is a cute little ice cream shop for atmosphere, but the actual ice cream was kind of just 'ok'. The waffle cone, in particular, was almost inedible from the amount of salt in it. Also, because I have pins in my ankle from a motorcycle accident, I generally like to sit down when I go out to eat, and there wasn't any place to sit comfortably. There are two small benches right outside the shop, but they were right in the blasting sun; the tables outside are for the neighboring coffee shop. So, I wound up walking over to the other side of the street and sitting on the curb in the shade. It was alright for that one time, but I probably won't visit again.",Positive,Negative,unknown,unknown,3
"Who needs luck in Vegas when there are Sprinkles Cupcakes? I didn't seek out Sprinkles. They came to me ... as I searched for In-N-Out Burger between the Vegas Strip and the High Roller ferris wheel ... there it was ... Sprinkles Cupcakes and Ice Cream. I have know idea what to do if life gives you lemons, but when life gives you Sprinkles Cupcakes, you eat them. You eat them now! I got a classic (and old-timey Sprinkles favorite) Red Velvet Cupcake with Cream Cheese Frosting and the iconic sprinkles dot. I was satisfied. Life was good. So, I got another Sprinkles cupcake, but this time a traditional Black & White Cupcake featuring Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Frosting. Mmmm...life was still good. Not wanting to be a pig, I then went healthy ... with a Vegan Red Velvet Cupcake with a big V for victory over my diet. Life was very good. Besides, it's better to leave Las Vegas filled with Sprinkles Cupcakes than with regret.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Knowing that the pastries come straight down to this little kiosk from the Bouchon restaurant upstairs made this an easy stop a few times during our stay at the Venetian. I'd much rather stop here for a quality snack than pay just as much for something generic at another spot. With all the food they throw at you inside these huge hotels, it is really nice to find the places that are quick, but with quality.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"Once you're inside the West Side Market, I know how it can be if you don't have a game plan. You have long lines, big decisions to make with vendors, and a need to shop with purpose before the lines get longer. So where do you go first? Let me make it easy: CrÃªpes De Luxe. I hear people get a little salty that the staff doesn't always come off as sunshine and rainbows. Um, hi! These saints are making hundreds of crepes per day and taking ultra picky requests from visitors, all while shouting over loud noises and trying to provide fast service. I'm normally not a fan of savory crepes, but both the savory and sweet options are superb. The Le Roi (bananas, peanut butter and chocolate) and the Florence (spinach, egg and gruyere cheese) are my favorite odd combo to get together. I don't normally stick around to eat it (I shop with purpose!), so I get it to-go. While they may not always say it explicitly, you can get a box! Just ask and they'll pack it up for you. Be advised: there's a line and its a slow process! Every crepe is handmade. You are waiting for quality, and its worth every second for these flavorful crepes. I swear, they are addicting.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"What can you say except this awesome little place serves up some great and creative ice cream flavors that are worth checking out! I always go for the two half scoops (as they are huge) and be sure to get several samples before selecting your flavors. My last trip there I got brown butter almond brittle and sweet potato with torched marshmellows. Both were solid with the brown butter taking the cake. Also be sure not to sleep on the waffle cone as they both smell and taste delicious. Even now when winter is coming, I'll expect to stop back by here sometime soon.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5

"I'screamed for ice cream and so here we are! I've been wanting to try this for a bit now and finally got to for a special occasion/reunion with long time friends. Very whimsical and colorful store interior with lots to look at and distract yourself from the large array of ice cream flavors and toppings. There is also a small confectionery corner with lots of different brownies and chocolates (kidneys couldn't handle that extra amount of sugar this time...) I got the classic sundae which comes with 3 scoops and topping of choice, liquid and one sprinkles choice costs $10.99. It's a good choice and the sampler is more than double and you get 9 scoops. The ice flavors are tempting and decadent. I chose birthday, mixed berry stracciatelli, and mom's apple pie. My favorites were the mom's apple pie and the mixed berry. I would say it is worth trying limited for very special occasions as the cost of the ice cream is almost exorbitant",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,4

"Love chocolate? This is a the place to be! The left of the store is the sundae shop where most run $10 but you get $1 for checking in on Yelp or get 10% off if you purchase chocolate first. We didn't have a chance to try one, but they looked delicious and we were told good for sharing. They even have a family sundae for $38! When you walk in, they gave us a free peppermint sample. The right of the shop is the chocolate. You can buy in bulk for just under $10 for half a pound, so pricey. But you can pick and choose what types you want, and so many good ones to choose from. There are also small bags of one kind of chocolates and if you buy 4 bags, you get a deal but still more expensive than buying the mini chocolate bags at Walgreens. I couldn't resist the hot chocolate pouches for 3/$12, I hope it tastes as good as the packaging looks. If you are looking for gifts, there are tins with assorted chocolates. Since we couldn't decide from all the different types, we got the big bag of 80 chocolates (more than 2lbs worth) for $27. There was a deal if you buy 2 bags, you get $5 off. These big bags come in a variety of bags, including mixed and Christmas chocolates. The staff were very helpful to tell us about the differing bags, and various products. The location is the between LINQ and Flamingo heading towards the High Roller. Even if you don't buy anything, come for the free chocolate square if you are in the area!",unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,4
"I found myself at Bouchon Bakery by way of a recommendation from a friend and fellow Yelper. She spoke highly of this spot, and her review was glowing, so on our most recent Vegas trip we decided to check it out. It's very small, and the menu isn't huge, but they have plenty of baked goods and coffee options to choose from. We each got a coffee and opted for a couple of macarons. Everything was delicious! And, the macarons are huge! The size was unlike any others I've had, but they were still the perfect consistency. If you're on the strip and looking for a spot to grab a light breakfast, or a quick bakery snack, I think Bouchon Bakery is a great place to do it! And bonus, since it's in The Venetian the view is absolutely beautiful!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4

"Do not go to this place unless you are ready to be disappointed. Me and my husband came to this place in hopes that I would find a sfogliatella. Normally they are a very very nice size as being a brooklynite I was expecting the nice size. What I got wasn't even the size of my hand. It was small extremely stale. They didn't even bother to put powdered sugar on the pastry. I was sooo upset that I spent that money on it. Next the lines aren't bad but the disorganization is a joke, we had been waiting for our order for about 15 minutes and our order was two sfogliatella and two canolli. Which by the way was also horrible.... not what I had expected from a place like this because he's world famous. Fix your business buddie it's really horrible. I will never step a foot back in this place, sad but true.",unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,1

"I can totally see why they are award winning! At 10 AM, a LOT of flavors were almost sold out or completely sold out. Get there much, much earlier if you would like to have your choice of donut flavor. My boyfriend and I ordered 1 crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e donut to share, however the owner (?) insisted that we get 2. In hindsight, it was a good idea because I definitely would not have wanted to share. The sugar layer on top was very crunchy, and satisfying to bite into. The inside filling was surprisingly not too sweet and complemented the fresh, soft dough. We also ordered an iced coffee, not pictured, that was very smooth and not sour. If I ever come back, I will definitely be stopping in. It is well worth the visit.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5

"I came here on a Sunday for a short cake break. I was pleasantly surprised to see how nice the bakery is designed and by the lovely atmosphere which is somewhat romantic/bohemian. There is a unique selection of delicious cakes including vegan options. They rotate their cake/frosting flavors frequently. I tried the chocolate cake with pistachio icing and my wife ordered the butternut squash cake with caramel icing. Both cakes were very well made, and delicious. They were rich in flavor and we left with our sweet tooth craving satisfied. There were several people who ordered coffee or tea, and had their laptops open doing work.

"Parking: I arrived at this location around 9PM at night and the parking was FULL. Very hard to find parking and when I did find parking, customers had their cars overlapped into the adjacent spot. So yeah, it aggravated me just a little. Inside the Cafe: First impression? Wow. This is a small place. It was genuinely busy. The line stretched all the way to the backroom. My friends and I waited about 10 minutes just to get to see the actual sweets and food. Menu: It's a cute menu. Hard to read when you're all the way in the back. Food: Expensive. Almost $2 per macaron & not a very wide selection of macarons either. I bought some sort of chocolate cake while my friends decided to get the macarons. My cake was $6-ish. It was very sweet. I didn't finish it because it was just too sweet for me to finish. The macarons that my friends bought were slightly stale. They weren't too impressed with the visit either. It might have been just that night. I'll try again when I'm in the area.",Positive,Negative,unknown,unknown,2

The price was high, but I wouldn't have minded paying it if the service was better. There was no line when I went. I entered the ice cream shop and no one was there, and no employees to be seen. I thought they were closed at first. After 5 minutes, a girl finally came out. She seemed put out that I wanted ice cream. She was not friendly what so ever.

"Chocolate lovers dream! It's a cold night in Vegas and we were walking around soaking in the sights when we spotted the Ghirardelli store. We decide to check it out mostly to get out of the cold air without our jackets that we left in the hotel. It is located in the alley by the Linq and the Linq high roller Ferris wheel is located at the end of the alley. We order the sea salt hot chocolate that comes with a little sea salt Ghirardelli square on top. Perfect! It was the perfect thing to drink while walking back to our hotel. I made a decision to order the brownie that looked killer to nibble on later in the day, they warmed it and it was devoured before we even left. Very rich! There was a island of the mini packets of Ghirardelli that you can grab a bag and fill with the different flavors you want to try, as well as already packed bags. There was several employees walking around giving samples of these mini squares. There was a cute little ornament they were selling and the employee told me they were selling a bag with a full bar of the peppermint chocolate flavor for the same price. Side note: I have to make so much effort to not gain $30 lbs because this is my favorite flavor! We ended up leaving with so much free chocolate! During hitter months they sell ice cream which I still saw so many people ordering even with it being cold outside!",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"What a cute place! The woman in the store was very friendly and offered to let me try samples! They have some odd flavors like cucumber and cantaloupe,which were both very refreshing! I can't wait to bring my sister here.",Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,5
"Strawberry-jalapeno ice cream! The color was pink as expected, with a summer-strawberry aroma. The first taste was fruit-forward, all strawberry with a full-bodied creamy mouth-feel. Then the quick bite of jalapeno hit, just enough to be fully spicy, but not so much as to burn and grab for water. A great ice cream starts in the kitchen, and this chef's passion for the craft played out in my waffle cone. All kidding aside, these guys can make ice cream! Mitchell's created a great memory for our trip to Cleveland.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"When you take on an establishment like ice cream you better have a damn good idea. Rolling out a dozen deviations of chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry flavor X may work for a summer time smash and grab shop but if your going to thrive and ultimately shatter perspective you have to have an ice cream flavor renaissance. Like bacon... or sweet corn.... or rosemary..... or a mojito recipe When I first heard of bacon flavored ice cream, I was utterly horrified, this sounds like some fiendish experiment played out by a fictional madman like Dr. Frankenstein. But still I'll try anything once and pay my cardiologist to worry about it later. I can't possibly warn you enough, it's like crack, who knew.... But enough about my impending doom. Sweet Republic truly soars above the competition, the innovation and product quality are simply outstanding. We have gone back numerous times and never been disappointed. The staff is excellent, the decco is dynamic, and of course the ice cream is world class. If you don't believe me just ask the flag burning liberal hippies at the New Times or the arrogant food snobs at Bon AppÃ©tit.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
Looking for good ice cream late Saturday night found this place on yelp. This little red building is tucked away off Grand and 10th dont blink you'll miss it. OMG what a find! Best ice cream I've had. You can tell they are homemade with passion. The flavors were old time favorites like chocolate and artisan flavors like fat Elvis wow. I had butter beer hubby had toffee burbon crunch yummy. Ice cream in a donut really it's perfect. The owners Brandon and Jennifer love what they do they told us the how the business started and what goes into their ice creams. You can tell they have a real passion and it shows In their product. I live on the west side but will make the drive to come back often worth the drive.,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5

It seems like you're bothering them when you order, which is very uncomfortable.

"We stood in line for a half hour on Saturday night and it was worth every minute. I come here anytime I am in the vecinity because there is nothing like it. The Salted caramel brownie is shipped in from heaven and on the first bite, you will hear angels sing. Their coffee is spectacular and the entire vibe is so eclectic and fun! Also try the salted caramel torte and macaroons! They are open 24 hours and so lines are better during off hours. This is a MUST DO if you are anywhere near Charlotte. There is nothing else quite like it.",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"I love the ice cream, and the flavor and quality were the best I ever had. I wish I could say it was great, but the service was very weird. The sundaes did not have whipped cream or cherry, although I was told they would, and I said I would like the toppings, YES PLEASE. Then, THE BANANA SPLIT HAD NO BANANA. Of course, eating the delicious ice cream all the way down to the bottom was not too much of a problem for my friend, and the lack of banana was verified. And I had to ask for a drink of water three times: each time I was given a smile and told I would have a small cup of water right away....and waited at the counter...and waited. I will bring my own water bottle for sure from now on...and I may try again to get some ice cream. But, lowered expectations are apparently required.",unknown,Positive,Negative,unknown,4

"Freshly made ice cream from fresh Wisconsin ice cream, I screamed for this frozen treat! The prices are a bit high, but so will you be after trying this frozen crack. They have a bunch I options and mixed in flavors. I love the everything. Just like my bagels, I got a little flavor of it all. Fortunately tey don't over do it and force 100 toppings in one bite. It's fairly consistently one piece per spoon.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"The world's best bakery! OMG! The pound cake is addictive. The only place in Charlotte I can find pure lavender (without lemon) macaroons. I'm afraid to taste anything other than what I've already had because Lord knows I don't need to find some other dessert to get addicted to. The only constructive criticism I have is they should not have food they are selling to folks be uncovered, in the open air, right at sneeze level in front of other nasty customers.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5

"Rating 3.5 TLDR: If youre looking for halo-halo, come here. However, don't be too surprised, it tastes like any other halo-halo. So, its really up to what youre craving. Please keep in mind, this rating is based solely off my order halo halo, and not a rating for their other desserts. Not TLDR: Its been a while since I've had some Filipino dessert; specifically halo-halo. Where I live now, there isnt halo halo. So, when I found out that this place had this, my wife and I had to check it out. We drove from Tempe to this little hole in the wall, and it was the perfect time for desserts since it was still pretty warm. We arrived, and got their signature dessert: halo halo. It was good, but nothing amazing. It did satisfy both our cravings though. The service was impeccable, and the other desserts looked great. However, I have to give it 3.5 stars for their most reviewed item; which left me unimpressed. Based on other reviews, I have no doubt the other desserts are good. Give this place a try based on the other reviews; however, if youre looking for a mind blowing halo-halo, come knowing that it tastes like the rest. Good but not AMAZING.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,3

"i was super excited to try this place after watching christina tossi on chefs table. all the stuff sounded SO NOMZ. on our recent trip to vegas, i told my bestie i wanted to stop by and try milk bar. we made a special trip to the cosmo and i bought one of each cookie and 2 crack pies (since it is highly talked up in chefs table). i must admit that chefs table was right in conveying that tossi loves sugar, the stuff i bought was SUPER sweet. it has to go with black coffee or tea or something. standalone, i thought it was too much. and i really don't get the hype of the crack pie.. tastes like butter and sugar?? which i know those are the ingredients, but whats so special??? anyways, i am curious about the cereal soft serve and other items on the menu, so maybe i'll stop by the LA location one day. also, i just remembered the workers there weren't all that friendly. i was all excited cause it was my first time at a milk bar and asked if the crack pie would survive in our 4 hour car ride home. i was answered with, ""you know theres a location in LA"". yes, i know there is a location in LA but this is my first time and i happen to be in LV and i want to buy everthing! hallo! anyways, maybe chefs table hyped it up too much but i was disappointed :/ *cosmo doesn't charge for parking if you leave within the hour, thank God for that!*",unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,2

The cluster of ooglers and droolers deciding what to order wasn't ideal, but some dude took our order and moved us along. i just told him i wanted something chocolate and chocolate with some chocolate. Whatever he picked out was perfect. The chocolate mousse-stuff went nicely with my Abita Jockamo IPA and the latest episode of Big Brother. All in all, our order was like $13 for 2 little bites and two bigger treats. Thanks be to the Entertainment Book for $5 off, bringing the total to $8.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,3

Red raspberry sorbet is a close second, but when you want to indulge, GCS is the way to go. Las Vegas has so many frozen yogurt and boba tea places, it's nice to have a go-to (real) ice cream destination that is quick, convenient and most importantly, delicious!

Not the best pain au chocolat I have had. It was not very flaky and seemed a little empty inside because there wasn't much layers from the dough. Could have used more chocolate filling too. But the beignet was good! The dough itself was not too sweet given the filling was. Too bad I didn't see any bread or brioche at this location or else I would have gotten it. I had some from the restaurant and loved it. The espresso here was a little too sour for my liking.,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,3

"There's more to this place than bakery. To be honest, I prefer the other bakery in Little Italy as far as sweets. But I will say this... Presti's has THE BEST Coconut Macaroon on the planet. I go there just to get those alone. They are huge, crusty on the outside, soft and delicate on the inside and half dipped in dark chocolate. Be sure not to put these babies in plastic though, they are best when the outside is crusty. Best to eat them as soon as you get them! There are some other notable baked goods, like the brownie cookie, the soft biscotti cookies, anise cookies and the higher end stuff in the far case like tiramisu and iced brownies. They also make a killer cappuccino. Now here is where Presti's shines... they've got tons of good food and their space is super cozy. Whenever I come home and don't feel like cooking, I head over to Presti's for some takeout. I love the chicken picatta and marsala, the clam linguini, the various other pasta dishes. Their cold salads like egg, potato and chicken salad taste like you made it at home. There's this polenta bake that I absolutely LOVE. The pizza is pretty decent, although I usually end up throwing on more cheese. At breakfast time, they have great croissant sandwiches. Generally, the food is very good and reasonably priced. There's a lot to choose from and the offerings aren't always the same. Presti's is a great place to sit and hang. The inside is warm and inviting and the outside seating is great. They are in the perfect location. You can enjoy free Wi-Fi as well. You will always find a bunch of locals on laptops. Be sure to take a number if need be. When it is really busy, they will go by the number tickets.",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"Can not for the life of me figure out what the hype is all about! Disgusting abominations of sugar on top of sugar, dense bready thick, dry, stupidly huge, so called donuts. Husband went downtown early sat to get some to try since we heard about the place being so great and that they ""sell out"". Yeah ok. All first timers or tourists and not repeat customers I'd be sure! 2 days later and they are still sitting on my counter, most untouched, after we ""tried"" a tasting of a few of them..... And I have a house full of kids, one of which is a teenage boy, if that tells you anything! If they won't eat it you KNOW it's bad! Lol! The cream brÃ»lÃ©e (best seller!?! Ugh!) was disgusting. Tasteless hard coating of topping that sticks in your teeth on top of basically bread with literally a teaspoon amount of supposed Bavarian creme (also not made fresh, definitely out of a can). Ick! Every one we tried had the exact same tasteless dense dense dense bread like dough. I would compare it very much like the French bread loaves you get at Walmart for $1 topped or filled with multiple variations of whatever disgusting sugar concoction you can think of. Frosting (any of them) is nothing special and entirely pointlessly overdone, tastes like store bought in the cake isle. Apple tart topped with bacon one was dry (as were all of them due to the ""bread"" dough they use). I'm not sure how in the world you can make an apple filling tasteless but they did it! Dumped straight out of a can. Super disappointed since that one looked the most promising. The pop tart one... Well that is one that is still sitting untouched on the counter. Just grossly huge, pop tart wrapped in bread, filled with some sort of sickly sweet jelly, and topped with more sugar type topping. Oh! And sprinkles! Puke! My kids wouldn't even touch it. There is also a sponge bob one so decorated with the gross frosting that my 7 yr old didn't event attempt it. Basically it is clear that the object of this place is to make things ""look"" interesting enough to buy but absolutely no attention to actual taste, quality or ingredients. Nothing even remotely tastes like it was hand made fresh. Everything is ingredients you can buy in the cake isle (and bread isle) at the grocery store and make yourself. Blagh! Hey #donutbar...You can stop saying #bestdonutsintheworld now please! My recommendation and by far superior quality, taste, freshness, service, and overall care of product is #deesdonuts on centennial and Durango! Go check them out and see the difference!",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,1
"Sweet Republic is a haven for frozen treat fiends. It is definitely one of the best ice cream parlors in the Valley, and according to the Food Network, creates one the Best Things I Ever Ate: Toffee Banofi sundae. Um, yes, I concur. I try to get a weekly sweet treat from Sweet Republic, and I am working on branching out from my favorite flavors to try all of their amazing creations. The Bananas Foster ice cream is just fantastic - sweet, subtle flavor of banana in ice cream form. I do not usually care for banana-flavored foods, but this is just so tasty. Of course, I also LOVE the Salted Butter Caramel, the Madagascar Vanilla, and Belgian Chocolate. The sorbet flavors are outstanding - for a huge pick me up, try the Basil Lime; for just fruity deliciousness, get the Coconut and Strawberry. Sweet Republic also does interesting flavor rotations, including Honey Blue Cheese, Bacon, White Truffle, and other holiday themed flavors. You could try a different flavor every week! Sweet Republic also has a menu full of amazing sundaes and ice cream creations. I love the ice cream sandwiches - my favorite flavor between two chocolate chip cookies - what could be better!? Now, be warned that Sweet Republic is not to be considered inexpensive. They have small servings and they aren't cheap. But, the extra money is worth it for those who enjoy fresh ingredients and local charm. If you can't make it to Scottsdale, check them out on Twitter to find out where their Chevy truck might be headed next!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"This place is AMAZING. I was in Charlotte for an overnight business trip and had found rave reviews about this place before going... I ended up going because they were open late (this location is open 24 hours!). Upon walking in around 8:30 p.m. on a Sunday night, I was surprised to see a line about 20 people long. Luckily, it went very quickly. Great staff, very helpful. I had a blueberry lemonade, which was incredible... along with some chocolate/cinnamon macarons and the famous salted caramel brownie. It was the perfect sweet treat for a late night. They offer lots of sandwiches and soups as well, but I had already had dinner... I can't recommend this place enough!! Moral of the story, if you walk in and see a line out the door--just wait it out. It's worth it.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
Amelie's is the perfect place to spend time day or night. The ambiance is sheer perfection and the pastries are delish. The menu is simple yet tasty and the fact that they are open 24 hours is a plus. They have free WiFi and it reminds me of Paris because you can sit at a table as long as you like and no one is going to rush you. It's one of those places that I bring people to who are visiting the city and a place I frequent even when I don't have company. It's simply divine.,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Items Selected: Carrot Cake Cupcake with Cream Cheese Frosting Bourbon Pecan and Salted Caramel Danish Strawberries and Cream Buttercake Monkey Bread Almond Croissant Located at 1402 Williamson Street and as such a logical follow-up to breakfast at Lazy Janes it was a short walk in the sun to Batch Bakehouse and with a selection of pastries even more sizable than the place I'd just been it was with much hemming-and-hawing that selections were made, another five pastries joining leftovers from Lazy Janes in a smorgasbord of sweets to be consumed throughout the course of the day. Trending far more artisan than its nearby neighbor with French techniques infusing classics from the American cookbook and the bakers themselves acting as servers it was only after several questions that I eventually settled on an order far smaller than I should have liked and beginning my tasting at the small countertop with a moist carrot cake topped in tangy cream cheese I knew right away that none of this one was leaving the store - a similar sentiment shared by later samples, though each was indeed eaten only in part with the rest saved for a later day snack. Moving from cupcake to the only item that would prove the least bit dull, suffice it to say that monkey bread is found better elsewhere, but moving on to arching layers not the least bit burdened by frangipane beneath a shattering shell I'd be really surprised if a better almond croissant can be found in town. Admittedly a bit sugar-saturated at this point it was onward to the dense butter cake that I progressed and, although enthusiasts from the Show Me State may claim the rounded muffin to be unauthentic, the creamy texture was divine - a similar superlative soon to be lavished on the buttery Danish with flavors both savory and sweet to spare, a light smokiness from the baked bourbon tickling the palate as candied pecans crunched with each bite.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"Cute little low key ice cream shop. They have great customer service and are super friendly, sociable, and helpful.

"Wonderful little ice cream/candy joint right next to the Windsor Restaurant. The interior isn't very large, but it's super inviting and has a very clean/kiddish vibe to it. I think it's the perfect atmosphere for a candy/ice cream joint! They do have a wonderful back patio that is right next to the Windsor patio, but is still separate from it. The patio is very clean and inviting. There are plenty of beautiful flowers and trees to enjoy while eating your meal. The seating and shading are comfy and there are misters to keep you cool. Their menu of ice cream is not very large, but the flavors are unique and are created daily. There are plenty of topping options as well. They have a wide selection of coffees (lattes, cappuccinos, teas, Americanos, etc), as well as toppers to include Soy Milk! I ordered an Iced Americano (12oz for 2$), and my husband ordered an ice cream sandwich. You can choose to create your own sandwich using any of their delicious cookies and ice cream options. They have waffle cones, pretzel cones, and a variety of other options to pair with your ice cream experience. Unfortunately, they do not serve yogurt or sorbet ice cream at this time, a deal breaker for those of us who can't/won't eat dairy! My family has been back several times as they can't get enough of Churn's unique and tasty goodies. Churn is a must try for any ice cream lover !",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,4

"For the winter, it's a ramen shop! They've had multiple ramen pop-ups in the past couple of years but I've never been able to come, so I was very excited to try it. Came with a friend on a Thursday night, pretty limited seating, so we had to wait for a little bit. There's a bar with 8 seats or so, and a 4 or 5 small tables set up. They had a tonkotsu, chicken shio, and vegetarian option for ramen. Of course we both had the tonkotsu. I was actually super impressed with the tonkotsu ramen, considering this is Cleveland (haha sorry not sorry). The broth was perfect, rich and savory and meaty, without being too salty or greasy. The tonkotsu ramen came with a piece of Charsiu, marinated soft boiled egg, corn, seaweed, enoki mushrooms and green onion. The ramen noodles were nice and chewy. The Charsiu was so tender and melt-in-your-mouth. The egg was a perfect soft boil and so flavorful! Everything was what I was looking for (but afraid to expect) in a ramen. And I didn't even feel bloated afterwards! Wish there was a little more meat though. There was a chili oil and a chili flake/powder (w cumin, Sichuan peppercorn, salt) that you could add to the ramen. I liked that it wasn't super spicy, so you could get a lot of flavor without burning your mouth. I added both to my ramen. My friend also got the iced tea, which comes in a huge glass bottle, and you get to keep the bottle! I didn't try it because I was feeling sick, but she enjoyed it. Anyways I loved this, 10/10 would come again.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
Visited this cute ice cream shop that is attached to Windsor. I love the variety of flavors that they have! You are able to sample anything that you'd like. I got a single split scoop of the Almond Joy and the chocolate mint. You can also add toppings like toasted marshmallow fluff as well. The ice cream is delicious and extremely flavorful. I highly recommend coming here especially after having a meal at Windsor.,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,5
"Ice cream heaven... Ever wonder what it's like to go to ice cream heaven? This is it folks. This place makes homemade ice cream and you can taste it. I've been trying all sorts of flavors and my favorite hands down is the graham central station which is for anyone who enjoys golden graham cereal and graham cracker crust. Luscious perfection... They have tons of flavors. They make every type of sundae, milkshake, smoothie, whatever you so please and honestly I haven't tasted anything I haven't liked yet. Second favorite would be the chocolate marshmallow and the marshmallows are so fresh & soft that it's mind blowing. For anyone looking for an extra deal, come on a Tuesday for $2 scoops.

"I definitely love this bakery, but I give it only 4 star because on my recent trip here. When I went it was extremely busy, both the cafe and the line to pick up pastries. The first issue upon arriving was that there were no more trays to pick out pastries and we had to wait about 10 minutes for someone to bring out more. Next, I tried ordering a cake on the Kiosk in the front because I assumed it'd be the fastest way. On the Kiosk, it displayed that most of the cakes were sold out so I just settled for one that was available. Although once I got to the cake case, I saw that they had all the flavors still available. Once I got to the cashier they were able to give me the cake a wanted instead, without troubles. Despite this, I hope they work on keeping the Kiosk more updated. I love all the pastries and I hope to return at a less busy time so I can try one of their drinks!",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
Great concept of a two-story ice cream shop in their ice cream factory. The ice cream certainly tastes homemade and the flavors they come up with are always worth a try. The only flavor that I didn't care for was the Christmas Ale ice cream. Way too heavy and decadent for my taste. The staff have the patience of Job with no one being able to make a quick decision. There's just too many good choices.,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,3

"Rewind is a matcha specialty cafe which I was really excited to try. I have been here for both ice cream and boba drinks. They have both soft serve and hard scoop artisanal varieties. I ordered the Matcha Madness soft serve which came with chocolate shavings and picky sticks. I found the matcha flavor to be bland unfortunately. The hard scoop ice creams are not available in matcha flavor. On to the drinks, I ordered the strawberry matcha latte at the recommended 75% sweetness. The matcha flavoring was quite prominent, I was very happy with my choice. I would like to try the Matcha Americano next. I also had the Butterfly Strawberry Lemonade. Its colors were so beautiful I hesitated to mix it up but alas, must move forward. This drink is pretty unique in that none of the flavors are distinctive. If someone handed me the drink I would not have guessed it contained strawberries or lemons. It was a little too sweet for me at 75%, I would order 50% next time.",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,4

"It's unclear if this is a temporary location: vinyl banner instead of a real sign outside, only one wall decorated (everything else is painted very bare white), strangely mismatched light wooden trash can, nothing displayed in the glass case... Don't expect to be offered samples like the local artisan ice cream or gelato shops (or even Baskin Robbins), as there is no ice cream on display and employees won't offer. I was greeted with ""For here or to go?"" which better suits a place with prices that are half of what this shop is charging. For some reason they were playing awful ""screaming for singing"" with electric guitar music. While I'm not expecting old-school soda shoppe/diner music, this was awful. Minus 1 star. $6.75 after tax+$1 for tip = almost $8 for my ""20 oz"" (cup size, not really that much soda, due to foam and overflow) float. Very overpriced (minus the second star), considering the ice cream did not have a pronounced vanilla flavor (was more ""grocery store"" vanilla as opposed to a French or Vanilla Bean flavor) and had a somewhat icy texture. It was ""okay"" and the root beer itself was a drinkable chilled temperature. The worker brought the root beer float out with the styrofoam to-go cup covered completely with streams of overflowing soda (minus a third star). Obviously he had not wiped it down and replied with ""there are napkins on your table"" when I discretely asked for napkins while pointing to the big mess. The young man did apologize after I had thoroughly wiped down the cup, removed the lid which was causing the overflow, and wiped it down again. The correct ""good customer service"" response should have been to quickly realize the mistake (it never should have happened in the first place), acknowledge it, apologize, and wipe down the cup with a clean, wet cloth while offering to ""top up"" the root beer in the float. I don't think these young, new employees have been trained or empowered to give excellent customer service though. A big problem is (I assume as I didn't get one) they don't have domed lids, so the shake's froth gets all over when they smash down the ice cream with a normal flat soda lid. I'm sure it would be even more horrific with whipped cream and a cherry. Please use domed lids! I am not giving them one star as they're local and still probably in the stage of figuring things out, and my float wasn't bad after all. I appreciate that the young man apologized for the messy cup, but it was ""too little, too late."" I do not see myself coming back, due to the high price, mediocre quality, and untrained customer service.",Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,2
"Yoooo, Mitchell's is the BEST. It's family owned, heavily involved in the community, & makes the best ice cream in town, hands down. Their pralines & cream ice cream is so freaking good, with caramelly ribbons spun through each scoop. The shop is always clean, its staff always friendly, & it's always cool to peek behind the scenes through the glass dividers to see exactly how the ice cream is made.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"Waiting in line no bog deal u can watch them make cakes and stuff, had the chocolate canoli was very good, best I had ever had, very good filling . Took home the Napoleon cake, was very good also. Price is a little high but I understand why, quality cost.",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Omg so yummy!!! We came out here on a Saturday night to try their famous dough melt. Of course, after seeing the Yelp pics, we had to try to cookie monster ice cream. It was so creamy and delicious! My husband and I split a dough melt with the cookie monster ice cream with waffle cone pieces (you get to choose a topping on the ice cream in the dough melt too!). We could've probably gotten our own because they tasted so good, but we definitely would've been overly full because they are quite big! I like the set-up of the outdoor seating area because they have plenty of room, and I think we may have snagged a seat if it weren't so hot out ;) we opted to eat in the car only for that reason! My husband is not one to go out of the way to get food/dessert, but he said ""this was definitely worth the 30 minute drive,"" so we will for sure be back!",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
I love Amelie's. Always nice food and the chai latte is very tasty. We go to Park Rd one most often.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Had read about this place last time I was in Phoenix and we happened to be in the Scottsdale area so decided to stop in. Had a line at 2:30pm, but moved pretty quickly. Seating is limited, but they do have a few tables outside. Also saw some board games coming out of line by the restrooms if you just want to chill for awhile. They have some ""awards"" on the wall while you are waiting to order with the menu placed behind them and the special on a small board on the counter. They will offer samples of you ask, but didn't seem overly friendly about it. Now to the Ice Cream, everyone enjoyed their choices with the possible exception of the Real Mint Chip. Found you either loved it or hated it. The Salted Caramel was a hit as was the Belgian Chocolate. I don't know if I'd go out of my way, but if in the area would visit again.",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"One of the best ice cream I've ever had. Can't remember the full names but on the two times I came here I ordered bourbon, strawberry (not the original strawberry) and taro coconut and all were so amazing. I even sampled multiple other flavors such as honey lavender, the peanut butter one, cookie and more. The ice cream is rich and creamy without being too overpowering. I also tried their Donut sandwhich and I really liked their donut as well. It was a pretty light donut so it complimented the ice cream very well, but I prefer just getting a cone or cup. The service was quick and incredible. I sampled almost all the flavors before choosing the flavors I wanted to order and although they were a little busy they did not seem to mind at all. 10/10 highly recommend this place, so delicious!",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
Just had the strawberry short cake ice cream and my wife had the one with bananas and teddy graham crackers and both were really good! Thanks to Keith for recommending this place that his friend owns!,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"This bakery is probably the best place we ate at while in Charlotte. It's cute, modern, chic and they sell great pastries. The dÃ©cor is nice (we ate in some kind of atrium, a covered outdoor area, didn't love it), I'd recommend eating in the actual cafÃ©, there's plenty to look at it (cool furniture, artwork, etc) and they play cool music. Service is nice, we got some lunch here, a few tartines (European style open sandwich, just one baguette slice on the bottom), mine (vegetarian) with pesto, mozarella and tomatoes (I got half), my husband got the full tartine - the ham and Gruyere cheese one. They weren't as good as the ones I had in Paris, but they were decent. Nice choice for a snack, they have a great selection of European sodas (San Pellegrino, etc). We got some chocolate croissants for the next morning's breakfast (they were very good) and delicious chocolate Ã©clairs to go (which were the best we had in a long time, the custard was just right). Amelie is a cute place to hang out for breakfast, lunch, meet with a friend. If you live in the area or visit Charlotte, give it a try, it won't disappoint. Great selection of pastries, desserts, lunch choices, good prices and free parking.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"I've actually been trying to come here since the last time I visited Las Vegas but it always seem to be closed when I tried to go. I FINALLY WENT! They had so many different pastries and baked goods to choose one. It took me a while to decide on the Better Nutter (reinvented nutter butter) and a tropezienne (not really sure if that's spelled correctly). My boyfriend got the strawberry croissant and the pain au chocolat. I really enjoyed the Better Nutter. It was very tasty, and brought back the memories of eating Nutter Butters but SOOOOO MUCH BETTER. I'd definitely come back for these =] highly recommended The tropezienne is like a bready pastry with cream in the middle, there was also strawberry slices in it. It was good but if I could only choose one I'd go for the Better Nutter. I also tried the strawberry croissant, and that was very tasty also. Overall, I'll be coming back to Bouchon on my next visit to Las Vegas",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"The macarons were amazing BUT this place is always closed! they say they close at 9 but I went here 3 weeks ago around 8:20 pm and they were closed, I went again the next week and they were closed early again! and then yesterday they posted this note saying they will stay closed for 4 days! wtf? i drive all the way to venetian and this is what I get?",unknown,Positive,Negative,unknown,1
"I loved go to Carlo's bakery at the Palazzo. Thankfully the lines weren't long, at all, and the service and pastries were top-notch. I will definitely be going back and bringing my guests who visit.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Ok, how adorable is this place? Parking is limited up front but there is a parking lot on the side with plenty of room. Walking in is like hopping back in time. It is a really cute little ice cream parlor. They have a bunch of fun nostalgic candy for sale too. My mom and I shared one of their seasonal freezes and it was so good. I am really glad we split it, they were nice enough to put it into two cups for us too. It was really good but also really sweet and I definitely would not have been able to finish one myself.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
Amazing. Incredible. Pure delight. Love Ghirardelli. Highly suggest the Seasalt Caramel Sundae or Shake. Both are amazing. Treat yourself. You've earned it. Yum. 5 stars!,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"I got this cake my daughter's birthday because she requested it because of the reputation of these cakes for being off the hook so obviously I'm very pissed because I paid $50 for a tiny ass cake that tastes like any cake that I could have gotten from the supermarket, nothing more. in fact it was a lot drier than nothing bundt cakes. Which cost less. Never again!",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,2
It's hard to get frozen custard wrong. The snowstorm I had was very good. The atmosphere was very nostalgic of an old ice cream parlor. The lines were so long many had to wait outside. Definitely worth the price - and wait.,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"I love Handel's ice cream!! My friend and I had gone to lunch and decided to stop by to get one of their delicious ice cream cones to top off a nice afternoon. When we walked up to the window we saw a woman in the back. We waited patiently for her to come up to the window. Two more customers walked up. My friend knocked on the window to get her attention, nothing. The other customer also knocked but nothing. When they walked away I called the business, but it was just an automated machine. After waiting 15 minutes we decided to leave. Very disappointed with the lack of service. Maybe there should be more than one person working behind the counter.",unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,2
A bit of a mixed bag from this place. We had one of the lobster tails and it was amazing. Light and crispy with a delicious filling. The cannoli on the other hand was virtually inedible. The cream inside was very grainy and the cannoli shell was far from crisp. We each tried one small bite and threw the rest away. Have had far better cannolis and cheaper ones too.,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,3
"Charming, cute, and happy. I love the adorable atmosphere, the nice employees and the adventurous flavors. I've never had a bad experience or tasted a bad flavor here. Any time I nearby and my sweet tooth is kicking in I will definitely stop by Churn. Bring back the carrot cake ice cream please!!!! (:",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Fun!! They have the ice cream that is made from the UW campus cows! The staff was pretty friendly but wasn't really too excited when I asked what their specials were. I had the orange chocolate chip, which I had never heard of before. It was pretty good and definitely unique, but not my new favorite. We ate our ice cream out on the terrace overlooking the lake and it was a nice afternoon. No line while we were there, but there was a big line of little kids as we were leaving.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"Good and friendly service. An institution. The custard seems different, perhaps sweeter than I remember. But good and worth the effort if you have a taste.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,3

"Bon Appetit named Sweet Republic a Top 10 Ice Cream Shop, so when I was in Phoenix, I went out of my way to pay them a visit. Thankfully, not too far out of my way. I had high expectations because of all the accolades bestowed on this shop by foodies in the know. My first impression was not good. It's located in a strip mall, with rickety outdoor tables and chairs situated in between two trash cans. The appearance does improve once you get in the front door. It's decorated nicely and there were a couple teenagers at a table playing board games they got from the stash of games at the back of the shop. It had a nice vibe. They rotate their flavors of ice cream and sorbet so you get what you get. Too bad the menu on the wall didn't match what was in the cases. I was disappointed they didn't have a chocolate peanut butter cup flavor. Instead, they had Peanut Butter Chip, which was churned peanuts with chocolate flakes. Nothing else looked appealing to me so that's what I ordered. The texture was weird- kind of icy, not creamy. There were little pieces of peanuts that didn't help matters and the teensy flakes of dark chocolate were not abundant enough to add to the flavor. It was altogether odd. My sister had lemon sorbet and her review was, ""Meh."" We couldn't really figure out what was so great about this place.",Positive,Negative,unknown,unknown,2
"I'm not sure which is better; the people watching, the atmosphere or their food. It's the perfect place for a first date, studying or going on after a night out on the town. It's very creative and artsy. It is super cozy and very relaxing. They serve great sandwiches like Turkey and Brie. They also have great pastries, now of course, if you don't like petit fours and croissants, tarts and quiche, don't go. I preferably was looking for cheesecake on first trip and was kindly told it's a French Bakery lol So on my next trip I tried out a few of their cream cheese croissants. Now that was heaven! It gets 4 stars, because it's a great place, but not 5 stars because they should have cheesecake.",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
Very good food and service. Good portions. Good selection. Love this casual location.,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
Made my first trip to Sweet Republic tonight.... Shared the butter toffee sundae with my lovely bride. It was the perfect size for two people to snack on. The young lady behind the counter welcomed us into the shop warmly... And explained everything about the process.... How everything is handmade. This told us as soon as we walked in that this was a special place. She also told us that Alton Brown from the Food TV channel will be back this month...always a fun thing. I can't wait to go back!!!,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"If there was an option to put more than five stars, I would. Got a baker's dozen donuts which was more than enough. I am not a fan of the designer donuts trend... but this place blows Pinkbox and O Face out of the water. We tried all the 'fun varieties' including the delicious and decadent S'mores pop tart donut. My colleague loved the vegan creme brÃ»lÃ©e one the best even not as a vegan. I loved the maple bourbon and the caramel latte one the best. Absolutely delicious and welcome to Vegas. PS if you buy twelve they give you a free donut!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"We heard about Novel from reviews of the grand avenue festival and decided to give it a try. Wow! I don't ever think I've tasted chocolate ice cream that was as smoooth and rich and creamy as that ever. I really want to try the doughnut ""cone"".",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
Their ice-cream is so good. Coming with all kind of interesting flavors and keep updating!,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Yum! The hardest part is figuring out what to get. The chocolate eclairs, apple tarts, and I don't even know the names of all the pastries I've gotten are soooo good. They make good latte and cappuccino also.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
Amazing ice cream - what I appreciate the most is the natural high quality ingredients....meyer lemon is insane and the owner Helen is so helpful. What an amazing small local business!!,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
