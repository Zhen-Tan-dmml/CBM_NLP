"wasn't too impressed. staff was super friendly, patient, and helpful. line was HUGE and staff said it wasn't that bad, and gets way worse. wait to order was 20 minutes...and wait for food was about 10 minutes. they serve ice cream and cupcakes, or a combo of both. ice cream was hit and miss, we tried 5 different flavors and only really liked about 2. i like the capn' crunch flavor, sandwiched between two peanut butter/chocolate cookies. it was HUGE. couldn't finish it all. none of my party tried the cupcakes, but they looked good. would I go back? don't think so...but the Linq is pretty nice.",3,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown
"The restaurant and the bakery are a must stop for me when I'm in town. There was a conference at the Venetian and the bakery that's inside had a line through the casino. I remembered this location and quickly ducked out of the conference to stop by to grab a coffee and breakfast pastry. I was so glad because this location was basically empty when I stopped in. Food: You cannot go wrong with anything you order from their bakeries. I've tried a number of things from them and my favorites are the oh-oh, chocolate croissant, mini brownie and toffee candy. I usually order an iced vanilla latte for my coffee choice too; it's better than the coffee chains nearby. Staff: Everyone is usually friendly and efficient with your order. I never have to wait too long even if the line is long. Location: this one is tucked away outside of the Venetian. It's upstairs from the Walgreens. Because it's kind of tucked away the line never gets that long.",4,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown

The crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e was amazing! The custard was so creamy & not overly sweet. My sister is addicted to the salted caramel brownies. I'm not a fan of it though. It's good but just a tad bit too sweet for me. The coffee is great, the employees are so friendly, the sweets are awesome, & they're open 24/7! Yes! 24/7! Can't get any better than that!

We told the employee we'd never been before and she was super nice. She began pulling out mini little silver spoons and offering us samples. I ultimately went with the salted caramel & milkiest chocolate scoops. The texture was my favorite part, it's tough to describe. Very creamy and smooth. My fiance loved the gooey butter cake. For the two of us it was about $12. Pricey but a fun experience. We'll be back!",4,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"I never got the chance to try the original location in California so I am happy I did since we got to stay at the Cosmopolitan. Since COVID, the hours and days are different for when they are open but if they are when you come you should definitely come try out their menu items. I went with their famous MILK butter pie. Rich buttery and great for a snack.

"My friend said a general rule of thumb is that if something looks good here, it is. I tried A LOT of stuff and everything was really good. Workers are hit or miss. Some of them were knowledgeable, and others just don't care. I asked one worker what the flavors of the chocolate cups were. She said, ""I don't know"". I waited and then she started guessing on a few of them but trailed off. I pointed at one, and I said, ""The one with the almond. Is that almond?"" and she said, ""Yeah, I think so."" I think her name was Mac. I wish she had a nametag on that said, ""Don't ask me"". She could have also easily asked the guy next to her. I highly recommend the chocolate cups. My favorite was the passion fruit one. And the French macaroons (macarons)... sooo good. I prefer the cream ones and my favorite was pistachio. I didn't like the cinnamon-sugar one - too grainy. I wish I had bought a gazillion and stuffed them in my suitcase to bring back with me. Go here! You will not regret it.

"The 3 star rating is based purely on the coffee and lobster tail. I would definitely visit again and try more treats to see if there's something better. When I went in the late morning there were only a few people in the store so I was served quickly and there was a large variety of items available. I ended up choosing the original lobster tail, which I was told had Bailey's flavored cream inside. I also got a hot coffee, which was a lot cheaper than I expected! Employees were friendly and helpful when I asked about flavor options. The downside was that there really wasn't any seating, so my husband and I wandered around the shops until we found a bench. The lobster tail was really crisp. Like really crisp. Causing an explosion of powdered sugar on my shirt and pants. The pastry dough tasted a bit stale, but I don't have much lobster tail experience so maybe this is the intention? The cream was indeed Bailey's flavored and plentiful. Definitely a messy pastry to eat on a bench, so I'd keep that in mind!",3,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

A great bakery in the heart of Little Italy. It was the only place open semi-late (9pm) on a weeknight in the area where we could grab dessert. I ended up with the cappuccino brownie and it was fantastic. Some of the staples like cassata cake were already sold out but they had quite the selection of desserts still available.

"5-Star - cereal milk soft serve 3-Star everything else. I ordered the gift box that came with: -cereal milk soft serve (cereal topping included) -slice of crack pie --on the sweet side. Was able to share this piece with 3 others, and even then I wished it came with a smaller piece. - 3 birthday cake truffles --wayyy too sweet. Skip this. -compost cookie--honestly could not understand the hype about this product. The whole thing came out to $23 or $24. Note I think if you bought each individually it would be about the same price... All in all, I am glad I tried all of the famous items on the menu, but I will come back for the soft serve only! Maybe I'll even be adventurous and try the crack pie soft serve next!",4,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"Fresh ice cream, great service, served in a bright/open setting: that's the Mitchell's experience! This location, in Ohio City, is right in the middle of great restaurants and shopping, and it's the place we go to for dessert after spending a few hours dining and exploring the area. The store-front is located in front of their large processing facility, so you can see the actual fresh ingredients going into their product. Nothing to hide hear: you can literally stand along a glass wall and watch ice cream being made! While you're there, don't forget to get some to go home with -- they'll even sell you some dry ice to make sure it makes it home safely. Seriously, I cannot get enough of this place. You should go NOW!",5,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive
"Yes, it is hyped up because of David Chang. No it is not the same as the Milk bar on the east coast in regards to sitting in and dining. It is as stated, a ""bar"" that serves quick desserts. Much like an expensive Starbucks, created by a 2 Star Michelin Chef... It is a very good option for dessert. Being local I've been back a few times during the day - no long lines and one Saturday night during CES and was 12 deep. Not a factor cause the staff was prepared and had the line moving pretty well. Each time that I have went, the staff was really helpful and if there was a lag in service, they apologized cause some of them were still learning how to make certain things. The Crack Pie - on point, just like the one I tried at the east coast Milk Bar. The crack pie in shake form - yeah 10 bucks but it is Vegas. Competition will cause the prices to lower a little and stabilize. (maybe) Really sweet and rich - so bring your sweet tooth or have something pretty savory beforehand. Cookies - had them all but my fav is the compost and Corn flake with choc. and marshmallow. The one I liked the least was the chocolate chocolate chip. That was a little too sweet for me but I'm sure there are people out there who like them. Birthday cake Truffle - Was ok to me but my cousin loves them. They don't have the steam buns... Yet, but I am hoping that will happen. Sad to see some of the reviews be really picky with a place that just opened up. Give it a second chance and see how they have evolved to work out their kinks. I know that some are looking for that ""experience"" - I get it. Then dine in at Momofuku for that. I'm glad that Momofuku and Milk Bar are here and I look forward to returning.",4,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Check your receipt!Check your receipt!Check your receipt! Different price when you check out! And cashier will add some products you didn't buy.

"We stopped by on a Friday night 40 minutes before their closing time, and the line was still pretty long! The menu is up on the wall so we had enough time to look it over and see what we wanted. The decor is super cute inside, and the lighting is perfect for some great pictures! They do have limited seating and they have a few tables outside as well. We were lucky to find us a little corner to sit down at, as everything else was already occupied. It was dirty though and had ice cream all over. We ended up ordering one Thai tea with boba and a vanilla cone with fruity pebbles and sprinkles. Our total was close to about $12.. Yikes, a little too high in my opinion.... The cashier was beyond friendly and he got us through quickly! We sat down and waited for our treats. The ice cream was pretty good and it was very creamy. We enjoyed the Thai tea (it was nothing special) and the boba was perfectly made. It was the right amount of chewyyyyyy! *It can get pretty expensive especially if there are a lot of ppl in your group. We don't have that big of a sweet tooth, so we ended up sharing our ice cream cone between three people. I can't imagine how much it would've been if we had all ordered one... Do come though cause it's pretty neat inside and a bunch of their other drinks look really cool and tasty! I will be back again to try those out.",4,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown
"Amazing donuts for affordable prices. I went in around noon, and they had a special of buy 1 get 1 free OR buy a box for $10. I'm not a huge donut fan because bread + lots of sugar makes me feel sick so I only got 2! (They close until all the donuts are all sold) FOOD 5/5: -Creme Brulee ($2): This is what their famous for because INSIDER FOOD showcased this particular donut online and it became a hit! I LOVED it, I'm a fan of regular creme brulee, and they did an amazing job of filling the cream inside the donut & having a sweet/crunch on the top. -Old Fashion Glazed (Free): This was fantastic! If your not into all the sweetness and bread, I strongly recommend this donut. Simple but very good. SERVICE 5/5: -Right when you get in your greeted by smiles and whoever is working is more than happy to recommend what they're most famous for & what flavors you like!",4,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown
"A great little place to escape the chilly Illinois weather! I stopped in here for coffee with a friend one day, had never tried this spot but have heard good things (and really wanna check out The Literary as well!) I was just looking for a cup of warmth and maybe a couple of sweet treats. We went in and it was so cute and intimate, a little bar near the window, some tables in the corner to work at, and a nice comfy couch with a gorgeous coffee table in the middle of the space. The walls were lined with various jams, cocktail mixes, teas, and coffees you could buy to try. A great little area to peruse while waiting for your coffee and food. I ended up ordering the Salted Orange Mocha and my friend got a Plain Black Coffee, I paired my yummy mocha with a decadent ooey-gooey salted caramel brownie and a flakey buttery classic croissant. The brownie was so rich and the salted caramel balanced it out nicely so the chocolate wasn't too overpowering. The croissant was very buttery and had a nice crisp flakey outside. The inside was fluffy and had those beautiful croissant layers you look for. My mocha really shocked me, surprisingly I don't typically like chocolate and orange together but I do love trying new things. The orange in this is super soft and doesn't have quite the punch I thought it would, it dances over your tongue and gets enveloped by the mocha. It's a very subtle concoction and I would definitely order it again! Overall this was a great coffee spot and it wasn't too crowded when we went in the afternoon. I think it may be a little overlooked with all the coffee shops on campus and downtown Champaign, I definitely think Hopscotch needs more recognition especially with all their cool coffee creations. I can't wait to go back and see what else they have to offer! * * * Check out my Instagram thatfoodiewithglasses",4,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown

The shop is located in the older downtown section of Las Vegas but we made a special trip to find them on recommendation of a friend who lives locally and were not disappointed! Some of the best donuts ever. Don't miss out on the poppa tart, which is a giant pop tart shaped donut decorated like a pop tart and then has an actual entire pop tart inside it when you bite in!! Also the candied bacon apple fritter is banging!! Creme BrÃ»lÃ©e, PBJ bar and blueberry myer lemon all amazing!

I tried the salted caramel macaron (pretty big), better nutter cookie sandwich (best thing ever for peanut butter lovers), chocolate croissant, and a regular croissant. Everything was ON POINT! So glad I was able to find this place, since it's a bit hidden. Must try while in Vegas. Located at The Venetian. They have several locations so hopefully you'll be able to find one of them.

"Great Dessert Place! Looking for something to satisfy your dessert craving? I recommend checking this place out! They have a variety of desserts here. They have a selection of different ice creams, my faves were the pistachio, the taro, and believe it or not, the unicorn poop, lol. The unicorn poop is purple vanilla ice cream with sprinkles. The Cookie Monster was good too, but it's very sweet. They also have boba, shaved ice drinks, floats and sobets. They have three non dairy ice cream flavors as well. What I got was the halo halo, a Filipino traditional dessert. They have a super special option that includes buko pandan. They top it with something crunchy which adds more texture to the halo halo. I enjoyed it! The way to eat a halo halo is to just go ahead and mix it all up. In Tagalog, halo halo, means mix mix, which is exactly the way to eat it. All the flavors become mixed together and it makes for a nice cold tasty treat!",5,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"You ever take a bite of something so good, and for just a split second you're mad? Like you've wasted so much time on other things? Their oatmeal pie is incredible. It's without a doubt the best oatmeal cookie I've ever had and the cream filling is a perfect compliment. It's not too sweet. It's a hefty sandwich about the size of a hamburger with a price to match, but it's worth every penny. We bought some other treats that we haven't even touched but if they're even half as good as the oatmeal pie they'll be fantastic.",5,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

If the donuts didn't do me in, the coffee did because it rocked my Friday morning. It was all so good I bought a round back for my co-workers to share the wealth.

"One of the iconic places on State, my roommate and I visit this place a lot when we stayed downtown. Even after moving to west Madison, we still go back pretty often when we are on State. You just can't say no to ice-cream, rich and creamy ice-cream. They have disclaimers that give you plenty of heads-up as to what is in store for you. Lots of milk, cream, dairy products, chocolates or whatever the flavor of the ice-cream is. My favorites are the zanzibar (three different types of chocolates, can it get better??), oreo espresso, and black raspberry. As it varies from person to person, the best way is still to try their generous samples and just see which one bought you over. Their menu also extends to sundaes, milkshakes, take-home pints etc, just in case you want to deviate a little from the usual cones or dishes.",4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Talk about a Hidden Gem!!!!!! Took my family on a little Spur of the moment Adventure downtown to visit a restaurant. The restaurant was decent not unimpressed however not impressed. That is until we decided to visit the little shops behind it. Only a few were open however one that was open at the time made our trip completely worth it!!! Novel ice cream shop !!!!! It is tucked away in a little cottage that used to house POWs in Phoenix from World War II. So the history behind it is pretty cool however that's nothing compared to The Taste, the Quality and the Service you will get from this little ice cream shop!!!! All of their ice cream is made from scratch, by hand....and I don't mean in a big vat. I mean by hand a few quarts at a time. They let our entire family taste each one of the flavors before we decided on our favorites. They serve it in cones, cups or between a waffle however my recommendation is the way we had it which is stuffed in a donut believe it or not! The donut was fresh and warm and ice cream was amazingly cold inside. Talk about sinful. Lol And of course the ice cream was amazing however shadowed slightly by the two people own the place !

"I love watching Cake Boss and always wondered, are those pastries and cake actually good? I stopped by, and the line was pretty long but I waited because I really wanted to try it. When we got to the front, I realized the line wasn't too bad, it's the people. They were all really slow. I think they should change the way they take orders, to be more efficient. I got a regular cannoli, chocolate cannoli and a lobster tail. I'd say it's pretty expensive, but it is Vegas. I wonder if the other locations are the same price. I thought both cannolis were pretty good and had a nice crunch to them. The lobster tail was definitely my favorite. I really liked the cream inside and the crispy pastry layers! I'd suggest you get this if you were going to get one thing. Overall, If you're a fan of Cake Boss, then definately come and try the pastries.

"I am a fan...and because of that, I stop pretty frequently...I'd say more than 50% of the time that I motor north into the Great Shining Beacon on the side of McDowell Mt. and Pinnacle Peak called ""North Scottsdale"", I stop off for cup or a cone! The ice cream is made with love and craftsmanship that surpasses that of most of the restaurants in the Greater Phoenix area...I really do love their Madagascar Vanilla Bean ice cream! Wonderful, delightful sweet treats...just about the best ice cream that I've ever had (and that includes the homemade frozen custard that I used to make...and I will tell you that nobody appreciates my own cooking more than I do!). So, Donald, why only 4 stars for the Republic? Is it just me? Am I xenophobic?...have something against ice cream based governmental systems?...maybe a lactose intolerance based grudge against the Republic and those for which it stands? No...no...I just want a smile out of somebody when I buy a cup or a cone and then maybe spend another $20-30 to take a little frozen delight home to the Beautiful Carin...I've been in this place 20 times or more and I never get more than a ""next"" out of the people dishing out the scoops! Or a hurried ""will that be all?"" when they are ready for me to be done and pay and get going... I try to chat...even stuff like ""how's your day?"" and ""boy, that looks great!"" is met with silence. Maybe it's just me... Last week, I dropped by on my way home from a visit with one of my attorneys (and you can believe me when I say I really needed a treat). It wasn't a busy afternoon...but again...I was greeted with...indifference. There was a sign in the window advertising for help...wanting people ""passionate"" about being there...OK, I see the passion in the ice cream...and the customer service isn't bad...not really...they always get to me eventually and I get what I want...but I couldn't say that anyone behind the counter has ever smiled at me...chatted with me...even when taking my money...sometimes quite a bit of money...it's a little bit disconcerting... Oh well, the ice cream here is the star of the show and I do like the ice cream!

"Went to grab dessert at night and figured why not try the gourmet chocolatier shop here as it's close to the Linq, where we were staying. Unfortunately, their machine broke or something which meant my cravings for a shake were crushed. Didn't think I came to a McDonalds, but alright. Four stars for a slightly above average experience despite not being able to snag a shake. More like a 3.5 probably. Line was extremely long but the staff were great. Location is amazing as it's in the heart of the strip and on the promenade. Prices and value suck but you come for the experience at least once. Anyways, the ice cream scoops are generous and I regretted opting for a triple scoop. I contemplated throwing away my bowl because it was so much but as an ice cream fanatic, I couldn't bring myself to do that. Friend got a scoop in the sugar cone and the cone was challenging to hold because the scoop was ginormous. Another friend opted for the Drinking Chocolate. Well, it's literally melted chocolate, extremely dense with chocolate. It was a debate between that or the hot chocolate and he noted he would get the standard hot chocolate in the future.

"Good donuts, damn good donuts. What else is there to know? Ah... if you insist... So I guess this place is famous. I didn't know, I just came downtown to pay a ticket and saw a neat little sign for a donut shop. Inside I go and I'm just blown away by the different types of donuts on display! Homer's donut? Matcha donut? Nutella donut? What!? Which should I try? The answer is ALL OF THEM! Haha okay not really, but I did buy a dozen. The french toast donut was my favorite. I believe they make it on request because mine came out hot, and I did have to wait additional time for it. It comes with syrup on the side as well. My only regret is not buying two! It was that good. I loved Homer's donut as well. I believe that was strawberry flavored icing on top? It was simple, but great. The strawberry split was SO good! My partner loved how it wasn't too sweet, and loved having creme and strawberries in the donut. I didn't order the creme brulee donut this time, but I hear it's their signature donut. Heck, they all look and taste like signature donuts! Instead of cooking breakfast I think I'll just order a french toast donut from here instead. It was bigger than all the donuts and very filling. They close when they're out of donuts and trust me, they will run out. I recommend arriving early as there's usually no line. Definitely a must try when you're in Las Vegas! PROTIP: Their menu changes DAILY! You can also order in advance on their website only during THE DAY BEFORE! And it has to be a dozen donuts, minimum. I believe the deadline is 6pm, but I could be mistaken. This saves a lot of time during busy weeks if there's a festival going on in the city.",5,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Had the worst experience here on a Monday afternoon. My two friends and I walk in and we were the ONLY people by the registers/dessert bar waiting to order desserts. The kid who with the brown hair and glasses that worked there kept calling out numbers (apparently you're suppose to grab a ticket when you walk in which Happens to be on the side where people exit) and they serve you according to your ticket number (because we live in the god damn 50's) My friends and I stood there for about 10 minutes when we finally ask if we can order desserts. The kid working there then scolds us about how we can only be served if we grab a ticket. I then replied that we will grab a ticket and the employee says ""I will serve you this time BUT NEXT TIME... Grab a ticket"" well guess what asshole, there won't be a next time. How about you serve your guests who are clearly not familiar with your stupid ticket service and kindly explain to them how your system works rather than making them feel like a moron. As our horrible experience continues, my friend orders about 4-5 delicious looking desserts. The employee then decides to make the rudest comment to her ""you know that saying... Don't go grocery shopping if you're hungry"" no sir, we do not know that saying, please elaborate where your are going with this statement. Sorry for ordering desserts and supplying you with a paycheck, maybe next time we will order one single cookie so you can make 2.34$ an hour. As my friend was being ""served"" by this four eyed ass hat I was patiently waiting to be served also. I look over at the other employee who continues to flip his ticket numbers and shouting out numbers. We were still the only people at the dessert bar.... seriously?! Clearly this employee was also a moron. Finally the first employee finishes helping my friend and I ask him what his favorite dessert is. He replies ""Well I don't eat junk food"" .......... ....... ............... Is this a fucking joke? You work in the restaurant industry clearly at a place that serves desserts and your response is that you don't eat junk food? Are you calling your employers delicious desserts ""junk""? Nice I did not know how to respond to this peasants comment, so I continued to order what I thought looked good. I then ask him how they serve the biscotti cookies and he replies ""we sell them by the pound"" I then asked if I could get a half pound of biscotti cookies and he looks at me and asks "".......well how many do you want"" I then said ""I want a half pound"" and he says ""yeah but how many do you want?"" I thought to myself ""Are you fucking with me child?"" I will take four cookies- I responded. They had two different cookies and I asked if the sign referred to the bottom ones ( the sign said cinnamon) and the worker responds ""um yeah... S is for cinnamon"" um, okay. Finally he rang me out and I tipped him. I'm not sure why honestly. Probably because he was towering over me as I was signing my receipt. I would have rather donated my money to starving homeless people in Cleveland. Worst customer service I have EVER experienced and we will never go back. Very sad considering the desserts were amazing.",1,Positive,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown

"This place was worth dusting off my keyboard for a yelp review. Precious describes the service, and Precious is the name of the woman who helped us. She was really cool and accommodating to me and more so to my kid, which is the way to my heart. My son apparently loves the place, and Precious wanted to help him out, decide what he should buy (he bought a bunch of cookies to bring back to his friends.) She was very down to Earth about it, and I appreciated it. She also seemed to enjoy her job and seemed like she actually liked the product she was selling. Shout out to the other two people there, all together, running a good thing. The 5 stars are because, with all that said above, the Milk Bar is also cool idea. Breakfast cereal and whole milk, turned into cookies and ice cream. I think it builds on that theme. And, the milk shakes we got were really good(we haven't tried the cookies yet.) My kid got the peppermint bark, and I got the cereal and milk with fruity pebbles. Beyond that, the location in the Cosmopolitan is awesome. I dug the hotel and the vibe and you gotta walk through the place to get to the Milk Bar. The only thing I'll say about prices, you're not just paying for quality, you're paying for the novelty and uniqueness of what they're selling. They basically have stuff that's really good, that you can't really get anywhere else. Overall, it's a great place, good people, amazing desserts, and it's fun to get there, ie, walk through the swanky Cosmopolitan.",5,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive

"Okay, so the first time I've ever heard of Sprinkles is when it opened in Las Vegas. I know, I know, I'm ""deprived"" or whatever you'd like to call it. Anyways, I went to the Linq with two of my friends with the intention of trying Sprinkles for the first time! Whenever I go to a popular cupcake place, if they have red velvet ... then that will be the flavor I'll be trying. It also helps that people rave about it. First off, they kind of have a ""schedule"" of flavors for the cupcakes. Certain flavors of cupcakes are only available certain days of the week. There are a few, however, that are available all the time, which includes their red velvet and vanilla I believe. So if there's a certain flavor you want to try, make sure to check their schedule! Each cupcake is $3.75, which seems normal (kind of....) for one of these popular cupcakeries. What's great is that they even have a mini cupcake treat available for you to buy for your dog for $2.50. My friend actually bought one for her doggie :) Awwww. Also love the fact that the plate they give you and the fork/knife are all wooden! It's cute and eco-friendly! When I first took a bite of the red velvet, I'll admit ... it wasn't heaven. BUT it was really good. The cake was really moist and flavorful. The frosting was really sweet and heavy, but that is what you expect from a cream cheese frosting. Sprinkles is probably one of the few places that could make a red velvet cupcake correctly. I've tried a lot of different ones and not all are as moist as Sprinkles so yay! Now I'm a little interested in how their Strawberry cupcake tastes like. I had considered getting one but ... I wasn't sure if I could finish it or if my friends wanted to help me finish it boooo They also have a ""Cupcake ATM"" outside. From what I heard, it's supposed to be 24 hours? You can order their cupcakes and/or cookies from it. However, the prices of the cupcakes, from what I noticed, is about 50 cents more expensive. I guess because it's 24 hours? Or the novelty of it? If it weren't for the fact that it's on the strip, I would go to Sprinkles more often. Alas, for me, it's not worth the trouble.",4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"Happy Birthday Donut Bar- 3 years old today!!!!! Such an accomplishment, and continuing to rock and sell out all the time. They have made the top 10 donut establishments across the country. When we arrived there was a line of patrons waiting and wanting to try these amazing delectable delights. There are so many to choose from. From Unicorn to Peanut butter and Jelly. Each is made fresh and they are differently priced. Upon entering off of 6th and Carson entrance, you walk up and are quickly greeted by wonderful counter people. They have so many options and are willing to take their time with you. They have espresso and coffee options as well. There is a small counter you can sit at, however seating is very limited. I obviously got several to say the least. The owner is very personable as I got the chance to meet him today. Pricing is a reflection of quality and presentation. Would def recommend.

The guy was really excited to torch the marshmallow fluff i ordered and it was perfect. Ice cream was amazing as expected. I got a double scoop because my eyes are bigger than my stomach and it was too much. Peanut butter tastes like a cookie as opposed to from out the jar. Tiramisu has the right hint of amaretto. Oh I also grabbed one of those salted caramel things in the front. I assume it's house made but wow it's so buttery salty and 50 cents! Hehe get one on the go.

Trust me it was...and i don't even care for vanilla ice cream...but it may be the best i have ever had. They make the ice cream by hand and it is an all natural Artisian ice cream made from all natural and local ingredients. They have board games to play and free Wi-fi as well...i mean how can you beat that.

"I was there for the first time on Sunday. I ordered a loaf of bread, turkey cheese sandwich and a lavendar lemonade to go. I never was told where to go get my drink, so I sat there with my number sign and waited, and waited and saw people who came in after me served promptly. So I wondered over to what looked like the place to get drinks and asked if a Lemonade was made long ago. I was told no, so I thought can I get one as I have been waiting now well into 20 min. I asked the gal who made sure to make at least five drinks for people who came in after me and get around slowly to making my drink. So, happy to sip the drink I waited, and waited for someone to collect my number (which was 1) and saw others get their food promply and I was never approached by a staff member to be asked what I ordered. After 30 min or so I flagged down someone and asked where and when I might get my food. Well, they had no idea what my order was and after roughly 45 minuted I got my order after pleading with a staff member. They threw in a cup of soup for the mix up but I have been a server in the past and felt that the cashier dropped the ball somehow as she saw how long I waited and never acknowledged me after I paid. It was early afternoon and slightly busy, but still they need more people making drinks and calling drinks loudly to the crowd waiting so they know what's going on and give instruction to people at point of check out where to go get beverage.

"Went at about 6:30 and I was able to try the specialties they had first... Aztec Chocolate was really good with a little bite at the end would recommend but I was looking for a sweet, sweet treat tonight... So I also tried the Dulce de Leche flavor and it was delicious... I got a scoop of vanilla bean and a scoop of dulce de leche... It came in a cool little Chinese takeout box with a fortune cookie... Would highly recommend especially if you have an out-of-towner...

My husband got the French toast (good but I'm not a big maple syrup fan - at least not in ice cream). He also got an award winning salted caramel ice cream that was PERFECTION.

"Christina Tosi is my favorite baker. The treats and desserts you get at Milk Bar are unlike anything you have ever had before. The success of Milk Bar can be summed up by saying it's the perfect combination of science and creativity. Cookies (4-5 stars) All are at least 4 stars but the sure winners are the Cornflake Chocolate Chip Marshmallow Cookie (which tastes like Frosted Flakes had a baby with a chocolate chip cookie) and the Compost Cookie (which incorporates salty treats to the sweet cookie to create a flavor explosion). Crack Pie (4.5 stars) - Don't think of this as pie. If you compare it to traditional pie, you may find it odd. Think of it more as if a butter cookie was fused with pie crust. It's unlike any dessert on the planet. It's equally as buttery as it is sweet and very satisfying. Cereal Milk Milkshake (3 stars) - The first few sips are incredible. It really does taste like cereal milk blended with ice cream. BUT it's incredibly sweet. So sweet that my husband and I couldn't even finish TOGETHER their smallest sized shake. If you can handle a ton of sugar, go for it! But if you're a weakling like me... maybe pass or just be OK with throwing some away. Birthday Cake (4.5 stars) - It's visually stunning! The cake is very spongy and light. And there are funfetti cookie dough crumbles throughout. This would be the world's perfect cake if it wasn't for... CHOCOLATE Birthday Cake (5 stars) - I normally don't like chocolate cake that much. I almost always prefer vanilla. But this one, WOW! The cake tastes like an Oreo Cookie in cake form. And the frosting tastes very similar to Oreo Cream. Also... We bought this cake and I totally forgot about it (because I normally don't want Chocolate cake). I ate it a whole WEEK after we bought it and the cake was still soft, spongy, and fresh as if it was just made that day.",5,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

I walked in ready to buy a bunch of chocolates. I had my mask on but my husband had a drink so he wasnt wearing one. The guy behind the counter very rudely told my husband to put his mask on. When my husband turned around to show him he was drinking, the guy told him to either put his mask on his ear or to leave the store, meanwhile there were 5 other people eating and drinking that he did not tell this to. We have no problem wearing masks but this was ridiculous and no one should be treated like this, especially loyal customers.

Also had a cup of coffee, which was quite bold and flavorful. For the two macarons and a small coffee, it was like 13 bucks==excessive!

"In looking for another ice cream place in Las Vegas, we ended up here. Intrigued by the business name, we approached and saw that they serve soft serve. One of the soft serve flavours is ""Cereal Milk"". I asked the server what it tasted like and he said, ""It's really hard to describe the taste, other than cereal milk."" So I replied, ""So....vanilla?"" And he said ""No, not vanilla. Let me give you a sample."" So he gave me a sample and the rest is history. It tasted like cereal milk! I said to the server, ""OMG this tastes like cereal milk"", and he laughed and said ""I know, hard to describe otherwise!"" Now I'm not usually an ice cream eater but I had to order myself a cup of this cereal milk soft serve, which blew my mind every time I tasted it. They had other flavours too, but honestly I couldn't tell you what they were - I didn't pay attention because I was so blown away by the cereal milk flavour. I did notice that they sell the flavour mixture so you can create your own cereal milk ice cream at home. So, it's no secret that the flavour is achieved by adding corn cereal powder to ice cream, among other things I'm sure. Next time I'm in Las Vegas, with kids or otherwise, I'm totally hitting this place up again!",5,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive

"Have always wanted to try the Momofuku milk bar in New York and never got the chance, so I was super excited to find this place in LV. Turned out to be my biggest disappointment in an ice cream, EVER. I got the signature cereal milk soft serve. The ice cream itself lacked richness and taste, felt like a weird middle ground between ice cream and sorbet. The cornflakes were not ordinary cornflakes. They were not flakes first of all; they were crushed and stuck together. They were not as crunchy; it felt like they have been left out for a while. Worst of all, they were SALTY. Who had the ingenious idea of combining salty and sweet?! And the price. The soft serve itself is 6$ and the cornflakes are an extra 1.25$. The whole thing comes out to about 8$ with tax. I have never paid so much for an ice cream and this is the worse ice cream I've ever had (I didn't even finish it... Me! Not finishing an ice cream?!). Perfect combination for a 1-star.",1,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"This is a fairly average cafe overall. The food offerings are slight and not meal-level, the pastries (that I've had) are unimpressive, the coffee is mediocre, the layout is spastic, the furnishings are uncomfortable, it is not particularly good for pleasant conversation or getting work done. It is, however, open 24 hours everyday and that makes it a great destination after 11:00pm when all the other cafes in town have closed. The service is good and the people working there are very friendly -- just as I would expect for such a friendly city. It has great potential if they can upscale the tables and chairs to more practical and comfortable pieces, improve the lighting, decrease the background noises, and make the layout more attractive, functional, and cohesive.",3,Negative,Negative,Positive,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"I am officially in love. Sinful Sweets DESTROYS any chocolate/candy store in existence. Not only do they have awesome, friendly, fun staff, but the expansive selection of chocolates, truffles, cake pops AND ice cream is fantastic. They even have samples of their chocolate out to try! Sure, the building this little place resides in may be a bit run down, but I think it just gives it personality! The shop inside is cute and modern. Milkshake Happy Hour (25% off from 4-7 p.m.)!! The girl working (I wish I'd gotten her name!) was awesomely patient and helpful as I debated for several minutes between flavors. Finally, I decided to go wild and got bittersweet symphony (coffee & chocolate), mint chocolate chip, red velvet, chocolate cookie dough & piece of cake (since you get four scoops of ice cream, I split the cake and cookie dough flavors). At my request, she blended in tons of (free!) extras, like Reese's and Butterfingers pieces. Finally, I asked her to top my shake with Andes mints, which she did enthusiastically. It came with a big, fat cute straw DIPPED in chocolate on the tip for an extra burst of chocolately goodness with each sip. She said it was the craziest shake she had made yet :) IT WAS HEAVEN. I'm surprised I didn't spiral into depression at the final sip. All the extras that didn't get blended in were at the bottom, soaked in milkshakey goodness, so I got to spoon it out for even more deliciousness. Go here.

"Updating my review to this place because I went back with my boyfriend a second time. Although the girl working was really nice, I had noticed that there were no chocolate based flavors. For how many options they had, I thought that was a little crazy to not have a traditional chocolate flavor (or even a chocolate peanut butter or something). Biggest reason for the review change---Last time I rated this place, my boyfriend was the one making the purchase, so he paid. This time, we went for the special they have which adds a macaroon and a toasted marshmallow on top of your ice cream. I thought the menu board said they were $10 each (which is too much money for what you get, in my opinion). I remember tipping on top of it. And then when I checked my bank statement the next day, it said I spent $28.24 here. Almost $30 for essentially two scoops of ice cream plus some toppings?! PASS! I don't think I'll come back here if these are their prices because their ice cream is not worth that much. Even had I tipped 20% (which I think I did), it should have been $25 (again too much....) so to randomly add an over $8 tip is outrageous for what you are getting. I'm not sure how that happened but I doubt I'd come back.

Was recently in Vegas and wanted to drop by to visit the famous Carlos Bakery from Cake Boss. It was actually very disappointing and a huge let down.

"Truly a disappointing experience. Having been to many 85 locations in CA, I had high hopes that this location would be an amazing addition to my new hometown. I came on Sunday, 3/8/20 at about 5:30 pm. There was a long line but that didn't initially bother me. However, when you enter the store, the line for the checkout (staffed by one cashier) was wrapped around inside. The line was right thru the middle of the pastry selection area, making it difficult to make any selection for the few pastries that were out as the people in line wouldn't move, even after asking politely if you could reach around them to select a pastry. The young man at the checkout was pleasant and very apologetic for the wait. I assured him I knew it wasn't his fault. Inadequate staffing is a managers fault and I saw no manager assisting in the mess I saw occurring in that store. What disgusted me to no end was the employee working the coffee bar. His hair was unkept and long and sticking out everywhere. He seemed to have no feeling of any urgency to do his job, as he was wandering all over the store while people stood waiting for their drinks. He wandered several times to the back of the store behind the swinging doors and then would wander back to the coffee making area and never washed his hands. The part where I wanted to vomit was when he made the drink, then carried it over across the aisle with his hand over the top of the cup - now full with coffee (there is no assembly line format for making drinks so it's very disorganized). I know that a food handlers permit is required in CA so I'm going to assume that one is required in NV as well. All the things I saw with this last employee violate the health code. And with the world gone mad about the coronavirus, it would behoove this particular employee to take health precautions seriously or find other employment. I did not have him remake my drink (as I was late for an engagement). And didn't have time to wait another 30 mins for a drink.

"The best ice cream I have ever had! I know have a reason to move to Phoenix/Scottsdale and the reason is Sweet Republic. The menu is like a all star list of ice cream and it took me a while to make a decision of what to try beyond the obvious everything. I went for a classic with the Madagascar Vanilla and a unique flavor with the Honey Blue Cheese to try to get an idea of Sweet Republic's range. WOW, they blew me away. The honey blue cheese was an oddly wonderful taste that I enjoy in its normal incarnation but found the ice cream version to be somehow better! The flavors were well developed and not over powering, especially the blue cheese which could have been a bully and ruined everything. A subtly savory sweet treat! The Madagascar vanilla was nothing short of perfect, the flavor was dead on, texture was perfect and best of all the silky creaminess worked together to develop my first official ice cream addiction needing intervention. The iconic ice cream flavor has a new high mark set with this one. I will without hesitation go out of my way to stop in at Sweet Republic anytime I am in the state of Arizona.

"I worked in a bakery for 3 years and swore off donuts from then on (about 8 years ago)... until I encountered Jack Frost Donuts. Then I came back to the dark side. I've been saying for awhile that I needed to venture out there and finally made it this past weekend. It was worth the drive. I got the maple bacon (!!!), German chocolate, and some chocolate creme deliciousness. All of it was great. Will be back for sure.",5,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown
"One of the few dessert places on the Strip that was recommended to me before I left for Christmas holiday. This is located inside the Cosmopolitan hotel. It is not obvious to find as the hotel malls themselves are a bit of a challenge to navigate through. Just as we were about to give up we found it...by luck. I got the fruity pebbles cereal soft serve. The soft serve was okay. I know that there are better ones in Vegas which I have been to (and will review later as I am catching up on all the Vegas reviews). It was super expensive, therefore, I shared a cone with my best friend which worked out for the best since we were going to a buffet later that day anyway. There is some sit down space inside but decided to just walk around the rest of the mall. Customer service was neutral.",3,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"I woke up this morning... 7 AM... because I was going to go try The Donut Bar. There was so much hype about this place from USA today to the food network to Ellen. I was energized and ready to go! I got there at 7:50 in the morning and it was easy to find parking. There was already a line of at least 40 people ahead of me who were also waiting for a shop that was about to open at 8 AM. The wait time to get in once the shop opens at 8 AM was 30 minutes in line outside. Luckily, it was a pleasant day. As I approached the inside of the store, I was surprised to see that I wasn't all that excited. I saw many very large looking donuts with hard tacky frosting that weren't at all appealing. The oversized amount made them less appealing rather than to appear yummy. The smaller donuts looked good and, by smaller, I mean normal size like Dunkin' Donuts regular donuts. The service was just OK. Whoever chose to run this place really doesn't seem to understand what the best environment for customer service is. It was glaring super loud music over the speakers where I could barely hear the person helping me and I'm not sure if they could hear me. I had to order several donuts for a party and thought this is a good place to try because it gets so much publicity so it has to be good. I decided to put my instincts aside because so many people were waiting in front of me and behind me to get into this place and it has gotten all these reviews. As I ordered, after two dozen donuts, the server just went off to help somebody else without even asking me if I was finished with my order. I couldn't believe it! I was very friendly during the whole interaction which is why this shocked me. I did not bother calling her back because I am not confrontational and simply will let something like this go, but won't let it go during a review. The donuts range from two dollars that are very small to some pastries that are upwards of four dollars. I ordered several donuts including the Twix, Samoa, blueberry with lemon, chai, Nutella, Red velvet, and the crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e. Here is what I have to say: firstly, you have to eat these donuts the day of because they are not as good the next day. With that being said, most of the donuts were not that impressive to begin with. They were just ok or disappointing. In fact, the crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e donut, which gets all of this amazing hype, was one of the worst ones of the bunch. The hard sugar/Caramel crust on top of the donut was so burnt that it carried a foul aftertaste. The donut itself had a yummy crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e center within the dough. The topping of the crunchy burnt sugar/Caramel ruined it. I also did not like that many of the donuts were grossly over sized with a great deal of tacky frosting on it which was glazed and dried off. I did order a couple of those and they were not very good. This place is OK. I did not try the coffee and I wonder if that would've changed my mind and increased their ratings. The donuts are so so. They aren't that much better than other places or don't cost a lot less so I do not know what people are talking about. Also, the wait time and price just isn't worth it. It is a very popular place and a lot of people come here. Not sure if there are people that love donuts so much that this is considered great quality??? I love food and have been very fortunate to taste some phenomenal food internationally at some of the best places. I know donuts and sadly, the donut bar does not have anywhere close to the best donuts around. The two stars are because it is expensive, the service was disappointing, the wait time to get the donuts was way too long for this,and the donuts did not impress. I am glad I tried it just take the hype away and I should have gone with my instincts.",2,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,unknown,Negative,unknown,Positive,Negative,Negative,Positive,unknown,unknown

The staff was fairly nice, but not overly helpful. The worst was that there were some seriously annoying high school wannabe-hipster girls in there who were yapping loudly at the table next to us. One of them sent her food back because, as she told the server, she was ""allergic to dairy,"" even though she then told her friends (quite loudly) that, really, she was just ""trying the whole vegan thing, like, lol!""

I've had bites of Justin's dairy concoctions which have included: lavender, chocolate chip, and salted caramel. from memory, they haven't had mint chocolate chip yet, but I'm sure they will at some point! we've been twice now, but on the third time, when the line was over 20 minutes, we decided to bail. thrilled that CLT is one of the few cities that Jeni's has expanded to. it's such a bright (literally!) spot in South End which makes our neighborhood even better.",5,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown

"TAIPEI BAKERY EMPIRE 85° C BAKERY is mastering the bake industry like a monster typhoon. Huge dominance in So-Cal and now has moved north on I-95 anchoring itself as a foodie hot spot in Chinatown's Shanghai Plaza Las Vegas. Its actually a big bakery shop, but dine-in section is closed for good reasons. The area where you personally select your pasteries is a free for all zone without any observance for social distancing. Sorta like a mob after a storm when all the fish are washed a shore. It was a scene from a Charlie Chaplin fire drill. Then you get in a queue to pay, and it's stand apart with four feet spacing. The cashiers are spaced even closer. Thank goodness everyone is respectfully masked. I choose five pasteries and three I would buy again and again.

I heard heard numerous good things about this place and was so eager to try and see what that was all about. Unfortunately my experience was negative and I will not be returning. The afternoon my three friends and I walked into amazing customer service from a young boy who was so kind in serving our sweet treats, which were quite delicious. We sat inside the establishment that day because it was a little chilly. What unfolded afterwards blew my mind. It seems that the mother of the employee came in to speak to the (new) owner about a few issues so my company and I paid no attention. Shortly (and I mean very shortly) there after the management took the conversation to an altercation type level with raised voice and all. WE WERE SHOCKED. Owner was shouting, blaming the young boy aloud for a broken mug, saying he would not receive tips. I could NOT believe my eyes and ears. I felt awful for this boy and as customers, we were put in such an awkward position sitting there while this was taking place. Our sweet trip turned sour VERY quickly. It's a shame. We will not be returning and truly hope for the best of the employees that remain under the example of management we witnessed that afternoon.",1,Positive,Negative,Negative,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

The lady who helped me with my order was personable, the place seemed clean, and the donuts did look quite nice. Oh and just a note, you have to pay with cash or check as they do not accept credit cards. Back to the donuts. I got a variety and my co-workers all said they tasted really good so that is what I am basing my review on. I did eat one and it was A-Ok, but it tasted like a regular donut to me so I can't really rate it on taste since it's not my thing, but I would definitely suggest this place to anyone who likes donuts!

"Mitchell's is one of the things about Cleveland which will make it hard to leave when the time comes. I am not an ice cream person, but when I am, I am a snob. If it isn't great, it isn't worth it. First, I love that they are very open and honest and meticulous about where they source their ingredients. Everything that can be purchased locally, is purchased locally. Second, I love that they have interesting and unique flavors. The Edmund Fitzgerald Porter ice cream is my favorite that I have ever had. It is not uncommon to find a pint of it in my freezer. I've also been stunned by the decadence of the caramelized chocolate. I don't love chocolate ice cream, but this is just amazing. Not too sweet. I've also tried most of their seasonal flavors--berry crumble, peach, apple cider concoctions, pumpkin spice, juniper/olive oil/orange--all amazing. They taste exactly the way that they should taste except better and creamier. Third, having cut dairy almost completely out of my everyday diet, their vegan ice cream is fantastic. Their vegan ice cream is better than most regular ice creams. It is wonderful, rich, creamy, good flavors, absolute excellence. The cookie dough ice cream has massive chunks of cookie dough in it. The peanut butter chocolate concoctions have loads of peanut butter and chocolate. It's a beautiful thing. The portions are generous (I usually get a junior size or a pint to go).

They always have a large variety. All the flavors sound good. Some of the flavors include classics like chocolate and vanilla. A few more exotic flavors include banana nut, maple with coconut bacon pieces, and strawberry. The donuts are $2 each, which isn't bad for something like this. It tastes just like regular donuts. That means they're good, and while they may not be much healthier they're made of higher quality. It doesn't have any room to sit inside.

I am always greeted with a smile and I feel welcomed anytime I come here. Now that I've tried other doughnuts in the Cleveland area, I will say that these are tasty. They are soft but actually a bit too sweet. It is almost as if you can taste the sugar. I especially feel this when I taste the Lavender doughnut. These are vegan doughnuts so they are made without milk. I do appreciate that the price has gone down from $3 a doughnut to $2 a doughnut which is affordable.

In any case, I usually end up going with tried and true favorites like I Love Bacon and Salted Caramel. This time around they didn't have the bacon ice cream so I went with their Sweet Potato and it was so delicious. Definitely put me in the mood for Thanksgiving! The quality of their ice cream is really great and you just can't beat some of their exciting flavor combinations. Basil Lime is so refreshing!

The taste of all of their pastries is just mouth watering! - croissant: it is the flakiest buttery croissant I ever had! It's huge but will be gone in 3 seconds. There is a few different kinds of croissants and can't go wrong with any of them. But the best to me is the original one - macaroons: all huge! Usually macaroons are a bit chewy or dry. Their center filling is super creamy and light! Which was a shock for me. Can't go wrong with any of the flavors but my favorite is pistachio and earl grey! - muffins: honestly their muffin is great. It's super moist and chewy. Maybe I'm not a muffin fan. Wasn't that impressed - cookies: there is a few variations of cookies. All great but I still think I had better. All in all, great stop if your at the Venetian. They have sandwiches and coffee which I have yet to try. But if I wanted that then I would go to grand Lux next door and I feel like it would be a lot better. No you come here for bakeries. All are amazing and can't go wrong at all in any choice you make. The only down side is that the service is a bit slow, they aren't as organized, and under staffed where it is only one or two people working. Also, the price! It is Vegas after all but usually each baked goods will be about 5 bucks each. But the size does make up for it, still kind of pricey since I usually leave with a good box full. -",4,Positive,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"Mm mm, smells good, looks good, tastes good. Hit the trifecta. The glass cases are filled with gems. Fresh crusty breads with my favorite being their epi, a French bread that looks like a branch. It is beautiful gift when you are invited to dinner at friend's house. Their sweets are divine. Little sandwich cookies that are just plain beautiful and slices of apple cake. Their chocolate chip cookies are excellent. Scones and brownies call your name and you pace wanting to pick just the right thing.

"I literally cannot stop laughing about this place. I mean, the sheer audacity of Brandon and Jenny Douglas to serve such unapologetically sinful desserts like this is just beyond comprehension. Warm donuts stuffed with ice cream? Waffle ice cream sandwiches? With cereal toppings? And a variety of glass bottled soda offerings? To those grossed out by this boldness, you might as well leave this review now. Me? I just had to see this for myself. After a soft opening in early March, I went to the Grand Opening Saturday night, appropriately enough the same weekend as Art Detour. Located on Grand Avenue & Fillmore in the same complex as ThirdSpace, Novel occupies the red building in back that has seen a number of concepts come and go over the years, but none with such an eye popping slogan out front as ""Ice Cream Stuffed Donuts"". Downtown Phoenix is certainly a friendly breeding ground for entrepreneurial experimentation, but could something this crazy actually work? Brandon and Jenny were delightful from the moment I walked in the door, and you can pick up on just how passionately devoted they are to their bold new concept. The ice cream flavors are made to their own specs, the donuts and waffles are made fresh in house, and they'll pretty much let you sample as many flavors as you want. With bold flavors like Bourbon Caramel Toffee Crunch, Cookie Monster, and Panna Cotta Cherry, as well as more familiar offerings like Butter Pecan, Madagascar Vanilla, and Mint. I counted 14 different flavor offerings this go around. If the ice cream and pastry combination wasn't crazy enough, did I mention toppings? From cereals? You've got options like Captain Crunch, Cookie Crisp, Fruity Pebbles, Fruit Loops and even Cocoa Puffs. I was craving a waffle this go around, so for me tonight would be a date with me and the Leslie Knope. And yes that is an entirely intentional reference to Amy Poehler's character on Parks & Rec. Two fresh made waffles with ice cream and a topping in the middle. My kryptonite of choice? Honey Lavender ice cream and Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Normally $5, tonight it was discounted at $3 for the grand opening (though I would've happily paid $5 for this magic). After a few minutes it was put together and placed in wax paper for sandwich style portability. The first bite had me filled with thoughts that I should maybe be remorseful for this obscene creation, but no, no I was not remorseful at all. Let's pretend calorie and cholesterol numbers don't count and I'll instead just tell you this is really good for you, and it will make you happy. Add Novel to the growing list of great restaurants dotting the landscape on Downtown's Grand Avenue food scene including Treehouse Bakery, Irma's Kitchen, and Barrio Cafe Gran Reserva. In addition to donuts and waffles stuffed with ice cream and toppings, they offer soda floats, traditional ice cream scoops on a waffle (or pretzel) cone, and even an ice cream flight of 5 flavors. And not a single item on the menu is more expensive than $8. Novel might leave you laughing about what you've just done to your diet or embarrassed to admit what you've eaten, but I think you'll find the mixed emotions worth the trouble. It may be early in Brandon and Jenny's fledgling concept, but from what I can see, they've hit on a winner.",5,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Boasting an astonishing variety of lovingly prepared ice cream and related tempting sweet treats all served fresh in a crisp, state of the art environment, Mitchell's is a world class establishment through and through. Though they have gradually attained something of a celebrity status in recent years, the fine folks at Mitchell's sacrifice none of their grassroots integrity in pursuit of turning larger profits. And their flavors just keep on getting tastier. The pralines & cream, while a bit of an underdog, according to one staff member, may be the best ice cream I've ever had the extreme good fortune of tasting. The 25th Street location is a gem: a sort of space age Wonka's workshop looms behind the order line, offering guests a firsthand view of just where the magic happens.

I had forgotten how tasty a donut can be until I stumbled upon this place while hanging in Downtown LV. Seriously, these guys know how make a donut explode with tastiness on your tongue.

"Good spot to grab some ice cream if you're staying @ the Palazzo (which we usually do), or at the Venetian, or are just shopping around the Grand Canal Shoppes. Probably wouldn't drive all the way here for just Sloan's, but again, it's a great option. It's tucked away in a small area of the shoppes right in front of the bridge that crosses over to the other side of the shoppes. Walk in and get in line, it forms a ""U"" shape that pretty much follows the walls of the little place, but just know that there are two registers, which can get a little confusing, esp when the lines get long, because the windows between each set of registers do not have the same exact flavors, at least not the last time I checked. A lot of options to pick from, and don't worry about the people behind, because you really should take your time and look at everything they have to offer. I've had a few flavors already, and liked them all so far; butter pecan, pistachio, mint n chip, vanilla. $5 for ice cream, which is expected 'round these parts, esp cuz of where you're at, but it's not a deal breaker. One of the last times we went, my little one opted for the Cookiewich, which from the picture on the menu on the wall doesn't look big, but i should've known once I saw that the price was $10...it's huge. They should've called it the giantwich, haha. Anyway, you can choose 3 cookies I think (I went with choc chip, so I don't even remember what the other options were), and you can choose your ice cream; she went vanilla, which was a great choice. It was pretty good, but even me at my hungriest couldn't finish that thing...prob meant to be shared with like 2 or 3 people. There are a lot of other options and even stuff to pickup while you're waiting in line, but it's all a little overwhelming and I never check it out because I typically just want ice cream and want to get back to the casino asap, hehe. Service has always been good for us, so nothing to complain about there either.

"I'm not new to 85 degrees, but wanted to share a review on to yelp! Once they've opened one in Vegas, a good majority of my money went here buying bread for my family, boba runs, and cakes for parties. -- Covid-19 review: Rules and regulations have changed since before Covid. Now that LV is in its second wave of reopening things, I've noticed that they don't regulate the amount of people who are inside the store with someone monitoring the entrance. -- Arrival: They practice social distancing with X's telling you where to stand. Each of the bread is individually wrapped and masks (just like everywhere else) are mandatory prior to entering the store. Sitting areas are closed. -- Staff: Everyone is wearing a mask and gloves. There is glass in front of the cashier to ensure social distancing rules. They're all so hardworking and make sure that the bread remains stocked. It's extremely busy with every customer grabbing more than at least 5+ items per visit. -- Menu: Their drink menu stays the same with new seasonal drinks being promoted here and there. The bread is kind of like a game of chance, you never know what's on display and there's no way to ensure you'll get a certain type of bread since it's in a first come first serve basis. -- Price: Extremely reasonable! For the amount they make everyday and the popularity of the location, I'm surprised they keep it at such a low price. Such a good reason to come back and try new items. -- FOOD: - Every food and drink is really top notch/consistent. Any location I visit, whether it's Vegas or Cali, the pastries all taste the same and rarely really misses the mark. -- Bonus: The times when you go and the bread you want is actually there, it's all worth it. -- Recommend? Go if you have the TIME to get all the delicious pastries. Don't go with an expectation to get a certain bakery item, it's most likely run out.",5,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"When I was a kid, Bill Cosby was one of America's Respected Men, believe it or not. And from the high perch of Saturday morning television, he often pontificated to the country's youth on how breakfast was the ""most important meal of the day."" For too many years, I took ""most important"" to mean ""very large."" That led to many unconfortable weekend days saddled with the results of Shoney's Breakfast Bar or some other horrible, oversized breakfast, sometimes administered in an effort to cure a hangover (but almost always exacerbating it). Having learned the error of my ways, I still think of breakfast as very important, but it's also important to keep it light. A place like Amelie's French Bakery is perfect for that. It has reasonably-sized, reasonably-priced egg sandwiches served on surprisingly decent baguettes, accompanied by very good coffee. There are plenty of great-looking pastries as well, although I didn't try those. You get to enjoy this fare in a dining area that looks like an undergrad's fantasy of classical French sophistication. I mean that in a good way: It's got a shabby-chic and comfortable appeal to it.

Sprinkles and all of the wonderful shops just opened up around February this year. I am looking forward to visiting this location again. The coffee is also a reasonable price. I loved it. The reason it is only getting 4 stars is because some of the flavors aren't as awesome as I thought they would be. The banana cupcake tasted like an overly sweet banana bread. The coconut is the best and I also enjoyed the salty caramel. I still have many flavors to try. Didn't have a chance to use the ATM, but someone else did and it took 10 minutes for the cupcake to come out. I don't know if it is suppose to take that long.

My kids ordered a scoop each of two different flavors, my hubby ordered two scoops of the caramel toffee (I can't remember the exact name) and I ordered two scoops of the honey lavender, which was delicious!! We really enjoy our ice cream. Hubs even loved his. They use real lavender flowers in the honey lavender and you can definitely taste the honey as well. The prices were a tad higher than what I'm used to paying when we go out for ice cream, but I'm okay with that since this is fresh, handmade ice cream. I'd definitely recommend this place and would also go here again!

"While staying at the Cosmopolitan , I was trying to stop at as many restaurants as possible and have the best LV dining experience as I could. Milk Bar is right near Egg Slut & the Juice Standard (reviews below) in the Boulevard Tower. To forewarn you, the menu is pretty extensive and a little bit difficult to navigate. I wasn't sure what I wanted - and that didn't help either. The girl at the register whose name is Lissa, helped me through the ordering process. She went through each of the things they offer and told me what the most popular items were & what her personal favorites were as well. That helped me figure out my order. I knew I wanted to do the three cookies for $10 deal and I went for the chocolate chip marshmallow cookie, the confetti cookie, and the compost cookie which is supposed to be their most popular. They also had a blueberry flavor, and a corn meal - which Lissa said was her favorite. They also had a new birthday cake flavored - scented balm they were selling. Most people use it on their lips but it's concentrated enough that you can use it on your hands as well. I love birthday cake flavored/scented anything and everything so I purchased that as well for $12. To round it all off- Lissa said that her favorite thing on the menu as well as the most popular item was the birthday cake truffles. She said hands-down you need to get that. So for an additional six dollars I purchased that as well. For $28 I got three cookies, a lip - hand balm, and the birthday cake truffles which was a set of three. I have to say, I was not a big fan of the compost cookie or the chocolate chip marshmallow cookie. The lip - hand balm was good for the lips but not great anywhere else. Wasn't the best purchase. Now-in my opinion, the confetti flavored cookie was unreal. Sugar cookie with rainbow/funfetti sprinkles inside. Also, the birthday truffles were no joke! Yum status. There was not really a long line at all when we went. In fact, every time we walked by there didn't seem like a long line. However there are always a few people there which is a good sign. It's a tad on the Las Vegas pricey side, but that's what you would expect. I did get a lot for under $30. Get your sweet tooth on.",3,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"Wish I could give 6 stars! Amazing donuts. We got there around 10 am- rookie move as selection picked over and they apparently don't replenish- what they have is what they sell. Still had enough interesting varieties to make it worth the drive. Don't overlook the glazed- simple but better than any we'd ever had. The kinds with lots of frosting were, as expected, a big hit.

"This place is awesome. Do they have 300 flavors with 600 toppings? No. That's probably why this place is so awesome. I need to start out with something about the lady who was working. I'm assuming she was an owner or someone else deeply involved in the whole process, and she was more than willing to fill us in on where the ingredients came from or any other details which she deemed necessary. They mostly weren't necessary but when you have someone that is that into what they are doing, you gotta have some love for it. Between the 4 of us we probably had 12 or so samples, and we did so without a bad look or skip in the record of our servers in depth guide to the flavors. I settled on the salted caramel ice cream, which was phenomenal. Silky, smooth, and buttery like a kobe bryant jump shot. Its 9AM right now and my mouth is watering thinking about it. There are so many flavors that you just generally would never see and as weird as they may seem, they all taste great. Next time in Scottsdale, theres a good chance I will hopefully be able to visit this hot spot (cool spot) again.",5,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"It's past midnight and still 90 degrees out. Cookies and ice cream sounded like the perfect snack. I'm not adventurous when it comes to ice cream because of my tree nut allergy so I had an oatmeal/sugar cookie (correction: snickerdoodle) vanilla ice cream sandwich. Both cookies were chewy, but a bit salty and didn't compliment the ice cream well. Even my friend thought I make a better cookie. The ice cream was a bit soft, but that's understandable with the Vegas heat. I will have to return to try a cupcake. They looked really good and had exotic flavors.",4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"I'm new in town and I love ice cream. I was excited to try this place because of the great reviews. I ordered a QT of Black Cherry and the Chocolate Malt with Caramel as well as the pineapple Sundae to go. The Sundae looked great, but when I got to the vanilla IceCream, it lacked the ""Vanilla"" and sugar, and tasted like creamy milk. I thought maybe I got a bad badge of vanilla IceCream. But when I finally tried the Black Cherry and the Chocolate Malt with Caramel....both were underwhelming as well. All the IceCream I ordered lacked sugar and how they're supposed to taste. The Black Cherry tasted just like the vanilla IceCream but with cherries and reddish food coloring and the chocolate malt was also lacking ""something"". I'm glad I tried this place, but I won't be back sadly. I gave it two stars because of how long I waited in line and how much I spent. It was edible and wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.",2,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

I was already stuffed from Trattoria, but I got a canoli, took 2 bites and brought it back to my hotel for after our nightly bar trip- perfect!

"I tried the macarons here when I indulged myself and got the six pack. For $17.50, I had high expectations considering Bouchon's reputation and all. Their macarons are twice the size of macarons that I've tried before so I was kind of digging that. Despite their bigger size, the taste and flavor were not compromised. The cream wasn't too sweet and the cookie part was soft and not dry. It's too bad that the pastry chef leader or team weren't there at the kiosk at the Venetian where I got these because I'd give each person a high-five for making such damn good macarons! It's a nice luxurious but expensive treat. For me, a nice reward to look forward to eat at the end of a typical crazy Vegas trip!

The salted caramel brownie was good. I really liked the brownie, and the caramel topping was okay although not really my thing. For $2.50 though, I would expect more than the tiny 1 oz brownie you get. The eclairs were decent too. I didn't really like the pastry part, but the vanilla and chocolate custards were both pretty tasty. My girlfriend and her mom were both disappointed that it was a custard filling rather than cream but enjoyed them nonetheless. I had one bite of a piece of chocolate cake and it was pretty good as well, but not anything worth $5 for a cupcake sized piece. After waiting in line for 10 minutes (it was Saturday evening, I'll give them that) and seeing the really high prices for the portions, I assumed these desserts must be heaven, but everyone in my group agreed they were just decent and nothing more.",3,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,Positive,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"I came here recently on a trip to Vegas and stopped by to check out the hype. I picked up a tin of 6 cookies as gifts ($17... $18 and change after tax) and also tried the fruity cereal milk soft serve topped with crushed corn flakes. The cereal milk soft serve tastes exactly like how you would expect it to. It was almost salty and not sweet at all. The salty taste probably came from the crushed corn flakes. Not a bad dessert, but definitely on the heavier side. I could go without this in the future. As for the cookies- tried 3: 1. Compost cookie- this cookie is a bit hard texturally and has a lot of interesting elements to it. Overall, tasted a lot like a toffee cookie to me with bits of pretzel. I give it 2-1/2 out of 5 stars. 2. Chocolate chip marshmallow cookie- 4/5- softer cookie and you definitely taste the corn flakes. I liked this one more than the compost. 3. Corn cookie- my fave and I can see why it's a cult classic. Would love to replicate this at home! 5/5!

"I was really excited to visit this famous Charlotte patisserie not only because everyone was raving about the their delicious tarts, croissants, & eclairs, but also because it's open ALL THE TIME (24hrs/day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year) and they are welcoming of all kinds of people to hangout, read, study. First off, the good: - Salted Caramel Brownie (5 stars): the PERFECT contrast of smooth sweet/salty caramel atop a thin but dense (and slightly crunchy) chocolate brownie. You must try this if you love either caramel or brownies! - Their creme brÃ»lÃ©e was delicious, and the fact that they flambÃ©/torch it only when ordered so it's warm, fresh, and crispy was a nice touch. - Finally, the chocolate eclair and mixed-berry tart were both very decent and I'd happily order them again. The only downside is that it was abundantly clear that those long hours really diminished the quality of at least 2 of their items: - The croissant: I had already ordered a few items so I wasn't planning to get anything else, but I'm a sucker for a great croissant and the lady at the counter said it was fresh baked that morning, so I happily ordered it expecting a soft, flaky, buttery snack. Unfortunately what I got was hard and dry; honestly, I've had day old croissants taste fresher than this! I have no doubt that if it were fresh out of the oven it would have been amazing, but someone definitely wasn't keeping track of how old/dry these were. - The sticky-bun (mini cinnamon roll + raisins & extra sugar glaze on top): it also was was disappointingly ""aged"" liked the croissant, and although I've got a notorious sweet tooth, this tasted way too sugary too me. Overall, I'd definitely come back for their delicious snacks/desserts that are not too perishable and to try their famous macaroons. As for the disappointing croissant, I'd be willing to try it again if I KNEW it was fresh, but otherwise skip it.",3,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"I came here for the Yelp Elite event Sunday evening. They closed the place just for us, and you could feel the tension in the air as the ""regular schmegular"" people walked up smiling, only to walk away in disgust. Oh well... I don't know if it was the fact that we were excited to try the ice cream, or that I'm sure many of us were having dessert BEFORE dinner! That NEVER happens in my world, but we all descended upon the place at once and the line was out of the door. Unfortunately, the weather did not care that we were standing outside because the rain began to pour down on us and we had to move our party inside. If you know anything about this place, it is small. So it became uncomfortable rather quickly, but as for me, I kept busy talking with a new friend from Florida and trying to narrow down my three top choices. I thought I was being proactive when I went online to look at the flavors and decide then, but the flavors were different. Just like many of the other ice cream shops, you are allowed to taste flavors before making a commitment. I tried the goat cheese with cherries and sweet corn with blackberries. In the end, I decided on the Gooey Butter cake first in the cone, followed by cream puff, and topped with goat cheese with red cherries. {Insert long, deep sigh here!} First of all, the flavors were strategically placed in the cone in a specific order because I had a feeling about that butter cake...everyone raved about it and whatever flavor is at the bottom of the cone, you get to enjoy most. See what I did there?!?! Let me just say that I live in the University City area and I would have zero problems driving over just for ice cream.

And, when I took my first bite, I fell in love. The macaron was crispy yet airy on the inside, and chewy filled with delicious cream in the middle. The macaron was absolutely perfect, and I had no complaints about it. However, when I visited Bouchon again this week, I was disappointed in the size of the macarons. Their macaron size now is very inconsistent, some were larger than others, and overall, the macarons had shrunk. When I ordered a box back in June, all the macarons were in perfect uniformity. Now, some were small, while other flavors were larger. I also tried the turkey sandwich, and fell in love. The bread has cranberries/raisins, and when toasted, it was a perfect complement to the turkey and brie cheese. I got this sandwich every morning and am still not sick of it. I plan on trying the other pastries when I visit Las Vegas again, but I hope that the macarons will not disappoint.

Parking can be a challenge, but we always find a way! There is only one bench seat along the side and there are milk crates in the back that can double as seats.

"Beyond disappointing. Went here the second day after they opened at 10 am there doors were shut. Went again an hour later the doors were still shut. Went to concierge and they called them and they lied to concierge saying they've been open since 10. We came back today 1/7/17 a few days. We ordered the deal sampler thing, a coffee milk shake, and the birthday quake. We were trying to get a quick treat before having to walk over to bellagio for o and wanted to get free parking at cosmo while it lasted. We had 45 min, which we thought was plenty of time. No one was in line and 3 shakes were ordered before us (they obviously got there things before us and we saw). There had to be about 7-10 people on staff there. Only 1 person was making orders, everyone else was chatting in front of the register while this poor girl is struggling to make these orders. We were given the cookies and truffles and pie at the register so we had those but had to wait 25 minutes to get our milk shake and quake. Then had to remind them to give us our soft serve which they made ever so slowly. it was ice cream and cornflakes. We weren't sure why it took so long but we went with it. The compost cookie was terrible. I like pretzels and stuff, but it just tried too hard. The crack pie is def overrated. I would prefer the pecans. The lady described it like a pecan pie without pecans, I wasn't paying attention so i got excited for pecans to realize she said without them. that's my b,. The birthday truffle was too sweet for me. The birthday quake had an off taste that i wasn't a fan of and the coffee milkshake wasn't sweet enough oddly. We then were out 60 bucks and didn't like anything. So we went back with the milk shake hopping they would remake us something else. We asked what they recommended and we got a chocolate shake. Can't go wrong with that. We then realized we jinxed it. It was bitter and not sweet, so we tossed it in a garbage and left. I love the cosmo hotel, but there not putting good things in place of the old, and the prices are just highway robbery. I don't see this location lasting and go there with no expectations that way you might enjoy overpriced desserts, or just go to sweet raku!",1,Negative,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown
A Charlotte ice cream staple and a must go to stop for ice cream! Jeni's has tons of unique flavors that you can't find in your typical grocery store!

"I heard about Sweet Republic being on a top ice cream list, so naturally I was so excited to try it. I love artisanal crafted ice cream, definitely preferred over Baskin Robbins or Cold Stone. I went on a hot summer day, and even though there was a line, it wasn't too bad. The servers are all very friendly and I got to try many of their flavors. I loved the salted butter caramel and the sweet corn. I'm excited to try the next season's flavors!! I was not disappointed by any of them and agreed that the ice cream was certainly some of the best! They have a nice sitting area equipped with board games and cards. Very clean and inviting! This is by far my new favorite ice cream shop in Arizona! :)",5,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown
"We are a fan of the show and have always wanted to go to their main store, but when my daughter and I heard about the shop on the strip we had to go. Their selection is not large, but what they do have is very good. My daughter and go the lobster tails and HOLY COW they were amazing. The next day (Sunday) we arrived early so we could get some goodies for the family, but they did not have any Cannolis. We got some more lobster tails, biscotti and White Chocolate Mouse Cake. My wife was very happy with the cake and my other daughter was disappointed they did not have any Connolis, but was very happy with the lobster tail.",4,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"This is ice cream at its best. You can tell that this comes from homemade recipes and you can tell that it's fresh and just delicious. The scoops are very generous so one scoop, in a cup or in a waffle bowl, is a lot bigger than I would expect. I got the black cherry scoop of ice cream in a waffle bowl. The ice cream was the best I have ever had for black cherry ice cream, no contest. The waffle bowl is freshly made on the premises and it was absolutely yummy. My friend got the bananas Foster ice cream and was pretty much in heaven. We got our son the chocoholic ice cream and it was amazing as well. We got lucky when we got there because there were only two people ahead of us. The lines tend to get long at times. We initially saw this place in California and the line to get the ice cream was around the building so we were excited to find one near us in Las Vegas. When we started ordering our ice cream, we noticed at least 20 people behind us. This is no surprise because the quality of the ice cream and the cones are incredible. The prices are right and I highly recommend it. We are definitely going back.",5,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive
"The atmosphere alone is worth 4 stars for me. And the croissant was good enough for me to keep trying with the food. What I loved - the atmosphere, the staff, the coffee (please, will the people who are falling to pieces about no skim or 2% just go to Starbucks and stop taking up space and breathing my full-fat air), my ham and cheese breakfast croissant, the mini-fruit tart. What I liked - the salted caramel brownie, which in no way resembles a brownie, but is very sweet and satisfying. I still have a small chocolate mousse waiting for sampling, and am just gonna give it the benefit of the doubt. What I didn't like - the rest of the pastry selection I sampled really suffered (but I'm a fighter, and I am gonna keep trying!!). The cream puff was several days old, it might have been better had in made recently but the one I had was quite stale. The same problem with the cherry turnover, I think this would be very nice if it had been fresh. But I won't order this one again. The chocolate croissant was just unfortunate. Whomever had made the croissant, or maybe served it, had been working with asiago cheese previously. So my chocolate croissant had a very distinct asiago cheese flavor - not good, not good at all. We were there at 9:00 on a Sunday - i would expect Saturday to be the biggest baking day, so maybe we were there early enough that they were clearing out the old stuff before stocking the newly baked goods.

We waited in line for about 25 minutes and was truly disappointed. We got: One yellow cupcake with buttercream - cake was dry and frosting was flavorless. One cream puff - The cream inside was once again flavorless and tasted like overcooked eggs. The pastry part was not flakey at all. One cup of strawberry shortcake - Besides the strawberry, I toss the cup away. The cake was once again dry and the whipped cream was flat. A sprinkle cookie - It was okay. Nothing worth the half hour wait. We tossed most of the items away, since it so bland. If you're going to eat something bad for your health, every bite better be worth it! This was not worth it. It's also overpriced and overcrowded, yet sadly the pastries are underachieved.",2,Negative,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown
"Are you kidding me? Where has this place been all my life? While visiting Cleveland for the weekend, my son and I decided to trek downtown so check out its 'renaissance' and we weren't disappointed. We decided to catch the sunset and city view from Edgewater Park and then opted to have dessert before heading back to the hotel. A quick search of the area suggested Mitchell's so we headed over. Love the area it's in (Market Square, near as I can tell) and the marquis out front. From the street, you can easily see you're in for a treat as it's bright, open and airy; an old-school ice cream parlor feel but with a modern vibe. Fortunately there was a small, but fast moving line when we entered. Being novices, we were happy to find a menu near the door so we could be prepared when we hit the counter (Seinfeld 'Soup Nazi' episode came to mind). Instead, the staff was all so happy and helpful and we decided on a waffle cone with a scoop of salted caramel and Mint chip. Yum Yum and Yum again. We discovered my son doesn't care for the former but we both the loved the latter. So creamy, perfectly minted and with magical chunks of chocolate. I found pricing reasonable at $6.50 for the portion size. The creamery is set up pretty neat with a large window behind the counter though which you can watch the kitchen in action (it was late so there wasn't much going at the time) but it's worth the trip upstairs for the birds eye view. I can't imagine going anywhere else for ice cream while in Cleveland. And from what I could tell, their flavors rotate and there are alway plenty of choices. Don't miss this spot!!",5,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive
"ooooooooo how delicious their cupcakes were!!!!!!! This place has a variety of choices for cupcakes and it is so worth to try it out! The promenade one even has a little cupcake ATM right outside of it in case you miss their operating hours or the line for the store is crowded for you. It only takes credit card, but during their hours you can go inside and go into the cupcake or ice cream area. They had plenty of people working the Sprinkles shop and didn't laugh when I went in the wrong area initially lol. I had the chocolate chip cookie cupcake and my mom had the coconut cupcake! The presentation in itself is marvelous and the way they package their items are so nice! And lastly, we loved the taste of the ones we got and almost snagged another available at the McCarran airport before we left for Cleveland.

Stop at Batch, pick up some baked goodness, eat, then wander around in the sun (attempting) to work off all that you inhaled. I had the plain croissant as well as a pain au fromage. Delicious. Perfectly baked. Perfectly flakey yet soft. The croissant had the right amount of ""bite"" to it. I have no negative comments about taste, staff, decor. I am glad they were able to move into a bigger location in the same neighborhood, though I do miss the smaller more intimate feel as now it has more of a mass-market kitchen feel to it. We were greeted when we walked in and quickly asked how they could help us. Help me?

"Honestly I had their cakes and crack pie. Have not been to the actual store but was given their Birthday Cake and Crack Pie. Birthday Cake could be a little bit ""too sweet"" for some but to me it was more rich than sweet. The Crack PIe is the business. If you freeze it it's even better. Again very rich and flavorful and a cross between pecan pie and peanut brittle (without the nuts) but it's one of those things where the whole pie is in front of you and 10 mins later you look down and nothing is there cause your fat ass ate the whole damn thing without realizing it. It's that good imo.

There's 100's of flavors to choose from, and they even have flavors of the month. You can ask for a sample, especially for those with vague descriptions like Graham Central Station. Prices aren't cheap, about $3.50 for a scoop. It was a nice scoop, and you can even say a generous scoop, but its still one scoop of ice cream. Was it the best ice cream I've ever had? Hmm, not sure.

"When Fatty Daddy's opened up, this place was really great. The main attractions were the Fatty Daddy or Mini Daddy cookie cups, but the ambiance and staff were amazing too. We went in the other night after not visiting in awhile and things felt... off. Cookie cup? Is that the same thing we used to get? I thought there were two sizes. My friend orders a cookie cup, but they only give him half a cookie and a smaller portion of ice cream than normal. The girl behind the counter was friendly, but seemed a little nervous. We asked where the amazing Steve Urkel picture went, and the girl explained the business is under new ownership. This explains everything. Even the POS system is different, and doesn't offer rewards or incentives. I even got a flier for Fatty Daddy's this week advertising ""Coffee, pastries, and ice cream, Relax, refresh, recharge!"" It's an ice cream spot, not a day spa. Say ""Ice cream, coffee, pastries"" at least- your name has the word Fatty in it... priorities people. Anyway. This spot is worth looking for and worth the trip. The ice cream flavors are a solid mix of classics and unique blends. If you've never been here before, you won't know the difference and it'll probably be a 5 star place for you. But I feel new management may have cut out some of the charm and is trying to skimp on things that made us come back for more.",1,unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"This place is just ok at best. I've had Sprinkles cupcakes before and wasn't crazy about them, but I wanted to try their ice cream anyway. I opted for a scoop of their salted caramel ice cream in a cup. I was warned by the guy at the counter that it was very salty. I asked for a taste and did find it on the salty side, so I asked for caramel sauce to make it sweeter and more caramel-y. The ice cream was ok - not terrible but not among the best I've had either. As for the caramel sauce, it was on the runnier side and I prefer it thick and more flavorful. There is plenty of seating outside but it was just too hot to sit out there on the day we went. Luckily there was counter seating on the cupcake side of the shop. (Ice cream is to the right when you enter; cupcakes to the left.) We had to wipe the counter top though - there were crumbs galore on it. It made no sense to me that they had a bunch of workers waiting to help on the cupcake side (most were not helping customers as there was a lull in foot traffic) and not one of them could wipe down the counter top. We returned later in the day with a friend who wanted to try their cupcake ATM, but it was out of service. This is one of those places where I can say that I'm glad that I tried it, but I don't feel the need to come back.",2,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown

I'm a big fan of shaved ice and have been seeing many different cultural versions of it. This Filipino version, while not served with shaved ice (I think it's crushed), was filled with a variety of ingredients.

Oh boy, it was 9am and there was already a long line waiting to place orders. Thank goodness they have a system of taking orders while you're in line so that you get your order and pay for it by the time you get to the cashier around the corner. Unfortunately, as I found out, when you place your order from around the corner, unless you already know what's being displayed at the front of the counter, you will only have seen the several awesomely delicious looking pastries on display......and likely have missed everything else at the front counter display around the corner. There were a few more items such as cookies, breakfast croissant and French baguette sandwiches, yoghurt, mixed fruit cups, etc. Yea, I could've added the items to my order, but it was so busy and I didn't want to get dirty looks from the customers in line behind me....plus everybody behind he counter was so busy that I didn't want to bother them......plus, I had already ordered more than enough. I ordered one raisin danish (ok, they called it something raisin in French, but I forget the name and spelling) and a blueberry muffin. Yes, they were both totally fresh and yummy! However, the raisin pastry I thought was a bit thin so you don't get the full usual fluffiness of the inside.....the outer crisp was nice and light though.

"This place had amazing reviews, and photos on Yelp looked amazing so we came out here for post-dinner dessert. I loved what I got, but was not overly impressed. So you can make your own bowl here meaning you pick your 2 flavors of gelato, your choice of macaroon, one topping, and they add on a fired roasted marshmallow on top. They had some AWESOME gelato flavors. I had the chocolate malt and the mango habanero. Let me jus say... Ive had ice cream with a kick before, but nothing like this mango habanero. It was SPICY, and I got the malt flavor (which was amazing) to neutralize it essentially. They obviously don't compliment each other, but the malt was good to switch to when my tongue needed a break from the habanero. Anyway, this place is a 4/5 and not a 5/5 because I just didn't feel like the macaroons were fresh or that good. I asked for the red velvet macaroon and I wasn't sure if they accidentally gave me the strawberry one. Regardless, it was alright. I think the macaroons overall here are underwhelming. The ice cream total was around $7 which I was OK with for the experience. Anyway, for the 'gram this place is great. And for kids! If you want an exotic, crazy colored macaroon like you see in some of the Yelp photos, they may not have those/didn't when we went. By the way, they do also have bubble tea! I didn't try any when I went, but there were some limited options on the menu. There are a few tables and it was pretty empty when we went on a Friday night!

"This is a decent bakery, above average. However, since it carries Thomas Keller's name as an offshoot of Bouchon Bistro, which is an excellent spot for a meal, it doesn't quite measure up. The turkey sandwich comes with cheddar(?), onion, and watercress on pecan bread. It was ok - you can tell the ingredients are good - but the sandwich itself wasn't outstanding. Most of the items seem to just miss the mark: the bacon(?), egg, and cheese croissant comes with a beautiful, fat slice of omelet but it's topped with a thin sliver of cheese; the Cobb salad is huge but bacon wasn't listed as an ingredient so I passed on that. The macarons are a nice size, great for splitting with a friend, and the croissants are buttery without feeling greasy. I'll be back for that Kouign Amann.",3,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"If you are staying at the Venetian then a trip to the Bouchon Bakery is a must. As others have mentioned it's tucked away under an escalator near the main elevator banks for the hotel. Another has opened on the street between the Venetian and Palazzo on the Venetian side. The ham and cheese on french bread grilled with mustard is pretty tasty as a lunch option. Mango yogurt is nice for breakfast, be warned definitely on the sweet side.

My boyfriend ordered a chocolate malt & received a vanilla one. If you decide to try it out (which I would advise against with so many better ice cream or gelato shops in the valley) ask for it ""to go"" as seating is limited.",1,Negative,Negative,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"This ice cream place is a cute store! Has so many toys and interesting things. I like the interior design in the store. The Vietnamese coffee tastes pretty good. But I ended up getting the strawberry ice cream. Their ice cream is really creamy and soft. Also, their scoops are so big! I couldn't finish one by myself. They had extra seating outside in the back with the water misters going on so that was nice. I was scared I was going to eat my ice cream in the heat because there is no inside seating. Only one thing I didn't like is how the ice cream was melting really quick. Its probably from the combination of the door being kept open and people were really crowded in that store. I also don't see why people like this place so much. It's okay. Nothing special to it just regular ice cream but I just went to try to say that I have gone there before.",3,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive

It was delicious! My husband had a Nutella and Java milkshake, and really enjoyed his drink as well. The interior was clean and super cute. This 80s baby loved the Steve Urkel painting on the wall. Jackson 5 songs were playing over the speakers, so it was a fun throwback atmosphere. The server who helped us was very polite, and encouraged us to try all their fun flavors, like the Urkel (chocolate and peanut butter) and Netflix and Chill (vanilla with popcorn and chocolate candy).

However, the cupcakes themselves were disappointing. The cake was relatively dry and lacked flavor. At nearly $5 a piece, I've experienced better at most other bakeries selling for the same price.

Now they have no indoor area to sit so that leaves just a couple of benches outside ( no tables ) as many of the other places in town have. If you have little ones I would get it to go.

Ill def be back to try other things and they also have a lot of old school cans y unused to eat when I was younger. I never really see them at stores anymore. Also the place is clean and the bathrooms are nice. Nice place to sit in the back by all the hipster bikes. Valet is free which is nice but I wish we could just park ourselves.

French Toast donut comes with berry jelly, butter and what I thought to be real maple syrup! If it wasn't 100% maple, it sure was great quality! I don't know if it was the customer service or the high-quality ingredients that was the most impressionable! Those who love coffee will understand this next statement....It was a bad coffee weekend until I tried the Portland Roast at The Donut Bar! Starbucks couldn't even hold their own this weekend.

Like when I first heard of it I didn't know what to expect, but when I had it, it literally tasted like the milk you'd have right after you finish eating all the cereal in the bowl. Haha I was so happy because I haven't had that taste in my mouth for a while. It was the perfect amount of sweetness (not too sweet which was perfect, like I didn't want to throw it away I just kept going at it) and I bought it with the corn flakes, so the crunch added texture and made it so pleasant to eat! I'm craving this right now tbh, which is why it has taking me so long to give a review, Staff members were super informative and sweet when I was there. So at that time service was 5/5 :)",5,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

This is your classic ice cream shop and one of the best in the Burgh! Even though it is only soft serve (all homemade with plenty of flavors) don't let that stop you from visiting. The menu is extensive with every kind of sundae and Arctic swirl combo you could imagine. The cookie crumb arctic swirl with Nancy B's chocolate chip cookies is one of my favorites. Also their fall menu with pumpkin ice cream is amazing! I highly recommend the pumpkin roll arctic swirl topped with a homemade pumpkin roll. The parking here is a bit tricky (gravel lot under a bridge) and no seating (outdoor counter only) but absolutely worth the stop and wait (can be long lines on the weekends).,5,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive

The lobster tail would have been better if it wasn't so darn hard. It was difficult to even take a bite it was so hard. Had good flavor but I threw most of it out. $10 down the drain. Also, as we were waiting for our items to be bagged up we noticed that the kitchen was a disaster. Maybe they shouldn't have windows.

"This is a cute little ice cream shop for atmosphere, but the actual ice cream was kind of just 'ok'. The waffle cone, in particular, was almost inedible from the amount of salt in it. Also, because I have pins in my ankle from a motorcycle accident, I generally like to sit down when I go out to eat, and there wasn't any place to sit comfortably. There are two small benches right outside the shop, but they were right in the blasting sun; the tables outside are for the neighboring coffee shop. So, I wound up walking over to the other side of the street and sitting on the curb in the shade. It was alright for that one time, but I probably won't visit again.",3,Negative,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

I have know idea what to do if life gives you lemons, but when life gives you Sprinkles Cupcakes, you eat them. You eat them now! I got a classic (and old-timey Sprinkles favorite) Red Velvet Cupcake with Cream Cheese Frosting and the iconic sprinkles dot. I was satisfied. Life was good. So, I got another Sprinkles cupcake, but this time a traditional Black & White Cupcake featuring Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Frosting. Mmmm...life was still good.

You have long lines, big decisions to make with vendors, and a need to shop with purpose before the lines get longer. So where do you go first? Let me make it easy: CrÃªpes De Luxe. I hear people get a little salty that the staff doesn't always come off as sunshine and rainbows. Um, hi! These saints are making hundreds of crepes per day and taking ultra picky requests from visitors, all while shouting over loud noises and trying to provide fast service. I'm normally not a fan of savory crepes, but both the savory and sweet options are superb. The Le Roi (bananas, peanut butter and chocolate) and the Florence (spinach, egg and gruyere cheese) are my favorite odd combo to get together. I don't normally stick around to eat it (I shop with purpose!), so I get it to-go. While they may not always say it explicitly, you can get a box! Just ask and they'll pack it up for you. Be advised: there's a line and its a slow process! Every crepe is handmade. You are waiting for quality, and its worth every second for these flavorful crepes.

Very whimsical and colorful store interior with lots to look at and distract yourself from the large array of ice cream flavors and toppings. There is also a small confectionery corner with lots of different brownies and chocolates (kidneys couldn't handle that extra amount of sugar this time...) I got the classic sundae which comes with 3 scoops and topping of choice, liquid and one sprinkles choice costs $10.99. It's a good choice and the sampler is more than double and you get 9 scoops. The ice flavors are tempting and decadent. I chose birthday, mixed berry stracciatelli, and mom's apple pie. My favorites were the mom's apple pie and the mixed berry.

We didn't have a chance to try one, but they looked delicious and we were told good for sharing. They even have a family sundae for $38! When you walk in, they gave us a free peppermint sample. The right of the shop is the chocolate. You can buy in bulk for just under $10 for half a pound, so pricey. But you can pick and choose what types you want, and so many good ones to choose from. There are also small bags of one kind of chocolates and if you buy 4 bags, you get a deal but still more expensive than buying the mini chocolate bags at Walgreens. I couldn't resist the hot chocolate pouches for 3/$12, I hope it tastes as good as the packaging looks. If you are looking for gifts, there are tins with assorted chocolates. Since we couldn't decide from all the different types, we got the big bag of 80 chocolates (more than 2lbs worth) for $27. There was a deal if you buy 2 bags, you get $5 off. These big bags come in a variety of bags, including mixed and Christmas chocolates. The staff were very helpful to tell us about the differing bags, and various products.

"Chocolate lovers dream! It's a cold night in Vegas and we were walking around soaking in the sights when we spotted the Ghirardelli store. We decide to check it out mostly to get out of the cold air without our jackets that we left in the hotel. It is located in the alley by the Linq and the Linq high roller Ferris wheel is located at the end of the alley. We order the sea salt hot chocolate that comes with a little sea salt Ghirardelli square on top. Perfect! It was the perfect thing to drink while walking back to our hotel. I made a decision to order the brownie that looked killer to nibble on later in the day, they warmed it and it was devoured before we even left. Very rich! There was a island of the mini packets of Ghirardelli that you can grab a bag and fill with the different flavors you want to try, as well as already packed bags. There was several employees walking around giving samples of these mini squares. There was a cute little ornament they were selling and the employee told me they were selling a bag with a full bar of the peppermint chocolate flavor for the same price. Side note: I have to make so much effort to not gain $30 lbs because this is my favorite flavor! We ended up leaving with so much free chocolate! During hitter months they sell ice cream which I still saw so many people ordering even with it being cold outside!",5,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Strawberry-jalapeno ice cream! The color was pink as expected, with a summer-strawberry aroma. The first taste was fruit-forward, all strawberry with a full-bodied creamy mouth-feel. Then the quick bite of jalapeno hit, just enough to be fully spicy, but not so much as to burn and grab for water. A great ice cream starts in the kitchen, and this chef's passion for the craft played out in my waffle cone. All kidding aside, these guys can make ice cream!

"When you take on an establishment like ice cream you better have a damn good idea. Rolling out a dozen deviations of chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry flavor X may work for a summer time smash and grab shop but if your going to thrive and ultimately shatter perspective you have to have an ice cream flavor renaissance. Like bacon... or sweet corn.... or rosemary..... or a mojito recipe When I first heard of bacon flavored ice cream, I was utterly horrified, this sounds like some fiendish experiment played out by a fictional madman like Dr. Frankenstein. But still I'll try anything once and pay my cardiologist to worry about it later. I can't possibly warn you enough, it's like crack, who knew.... But enough about my impending doom. Sweet Republic truly soars above the competition, the innovation and product quality are simply outstanding. We have gone back numerous times and never been disappointed. The staff is excellent, the decco is dynamic, and of course the ice cream is world class.

Looking for good ice cream late Saturday night found this place on yelp. This little red building is tucked away off Grand and 10th dont blink you'll miss it. OMG what a find!

I had butter beer hubby had toffee burbon crunch yummy. Ice cream in a donut really it's perfect. The owners Brandon and Jennifer love what they do they told us the how the business started and what goes into their ice creams. You can tell they have a real passion and it shows In their product.

Of course, eating the delicious ice cream all the way down to the bottom was not too much of a problem for my friend, and the lack of banana was verified. And I had to ask for a drink of water three times: each time I was given a smile and told I would have a small cup of water right away....and waited at the counter...and waited.

"Rating 3.5 TLDR: If youre looking for halo-halo, come here. However, don't be too surprised, it tastes like any other halo-halo. So, its really up to what youre craving. Please keep in mind, this rating is based solely off my order halo halo, and not a rating for their other desserts. Not TLDR: Its been a while since I've had some Filipino dessert; specifically halo-halo. Where I live now, there isnt halo halo. So, when I found out that this place had this, my wife and I had to check it out. We drove from Tempe to this little hole in the wall, and it was the perfect time for desserts since it was still pretty warm. We arrived, and got their signature dessert: halo halo. It was good, but nothing amazing. It did satisfy both our cravings though. The service was impeccable, and the other desserts looked great. However, I have to give it 3.5 stars for their most reviewed item; which left me unimpressed. Based on other reviews, I have no doubt the other desserts are good.

Not the best pain au chocolat I have had. It was not very flaky and seemed a little empty inside because there wasn't much layers from the dough. Could have used more chocolate filling too.

"There's more to this place than bakery. To be honest, I prefer the other bakery in Little Italy as far as sweets. But I will say this... Presti's has THE BEST Coconut Macaroon on the planet. I go there just to get those alone. They are huge, crusty on the outside, soft and delicate on the inside and half dipped in dark chocolate. Be sure not to put these babies in plastic though, they are best when the outside is crusty. Best to eat them as soon as you get them! There are some other notable baked goods, like the brownie cookie, the soft biscotti cookies, anise cookies and the higher end stuff in the far case like tiramisu and iced brownies. They also make a killer cappuccino. Now here is where Presti's shines... they've got tons of good food and their space is super cozy. Whenever I come home and don't feel like cooking, I head over to Presti's for some takeout. I love the chicken picatta and marsala, the clam linguini, the various other pasta dishes. Their cold salads like egg, potato and chicken salad taste like you made it at home. There's this polenta bake that I absolutely LOVE. The pizza is pretty decent, although I usually end up throwing on more cheese. At breakfast time, they have great croissant sandwiches. Generally, the food is very good and reasonably priced. There's a lot to choose from and the offerings aren't always the same. Presti's is a great place to sit and hang. The inside is warm and inviting and the outside seating is great. They are in the perfect location. You can enjoy free Wi-Fi as well. You will always find a bunch of locals on laptops. Be sure to take a number if need be.

"Can not for the life of me figure out what the hype is all about! Disgusting abominations of sugar on top of sugar, dense bready thick, dry, stupidly huge, so called donuts. Husband went downtown early sat to get some to try since we heard about the place being so great and that they ""sell out"". Yeah ok. All first timers or tourists and not repeat customers I'd be sure! 2 days later and they are still sitting on my counter, most untouched, after we ""tried"" a tasting of a few of them..... And I have a house full of kids, one of which is a teenage boy, if that tells you anything! If they won't eat it you KNOW it's bad! Lol! The cream brÃ»lÃ©e (best seller!?! Ugh!) was disgusting. Tasteless hard coating of topping that sticks in your teeth on top of basically bread with literally a teaspoon amount of supposed Bavarian creme (also not made fresh, definitely out of a can). Ick! Every one we tried had the exact same tasteless dense dense dense bread like dough. I would compare it very much like the French bread loaves you get at Walmart for $1 topped or filled with multiple variations of whatever disgusting sugar concoction you can think of. Frosting (any of them) is nothing special and entirely pointlessly overdone, tastes like store bought in the cake isle. Apple tart topped with bacon one was dry (as were all of them due to the ""bread"" dough they use). I'm not sure how in the world you can make an apple filling tasteless but they did it! Dumped straight out of a can. Super disappointed since that one looked the most promising. The pop tart one... Well that is one that is still sitting untouched on the counter. Just grossly huge, pop tart wrapped in bread, filled with some sort of sickly sweet jelly, and topped with more sugar type topping. Oh! And sprinkles! Puke! My kids wouldn't even touch it. There is also a sponge bob one so decorated with the gross frosting that my 7 yr old didn't event attempt it. Basically it is clear that the object of this place is to make things ""look"" interesting enough to buy but absolutely no attention to actual taste, quality or ingredients. Nothing even remotely tastes like it was hand made fresh. Everything is ingredients you can buy in the cake isle (and bread isle) at the grocery store and make yourself. Blagh! Hey #donutbar...You can stop saying #bestdonutsintheworld now please! My recommendation and by far superior quality, taste, freshness, service, and overall care of product is #deesdonuts on centennial and Durango!

"Sweet Republic is a haven for frozen treat fiends. It is definitely one of the best ice cream parlors in the Valley, and according to the Food Network, creates one the Best Things I Ever Ate: Toffee Banofi sundae. Um, yes, I concur. I try to get a weekly sweet treat from Sweet Republic, and I am working on branching out from my favorite flavors to try all of their amazing creations. The Bananas Foster ice cream is just fantastic - sweet, subtle flavor of banana in ice cream form. I do not usually care for banana-flavored foods, but this is just so tasty. Of course, I also LOVE the Salted Butter Caramel, the Madagascar Vanilla, and Belgian Chocolate. The sorbet flavors are outstanding - for a huge pick me up, try the Basil Lime; for just fruity deliciousness, get the Coconut and Strawberry. Sweet Republic also does interesting flavor rotations, including Honey Blue Cheese, Bacon, White Truffle, and other holiday themed flavors. You could try a different flavor every week! Sweet Republic also has a menu full of amazing sundaes and ice cream creations. I love the ice cream sandwiches - my favorite flavor between two chocolate chip cookies - what could be better!? Now, be warned that Sweet Republic is not to be considered inexpensive. They have small servings and they aren't cheap.

It was the perfect sweet treat for a late night. They offer lots of sandwiches and soups as well, but I had already had dinner... I can't recommend this place enough!!

"Items Selected: Carrot Cake Cupcake with Cream Cheese Frosting Bourbon Pecan and Salted Caramel Danish Strawberries and Cream Buttercake Monkey Bread Almond Croissant Located at 1402 Williamson Street and as such a logical follow-up to breakfast at Lazy Janes it was a short walk in the sun to Batch Bakehouse and with a selection of pastries even more sizable than the place I'd just been it was with much hemming-and-hawing that selections were made, another five pastries joining leftovers from Lazy Janes in a smorgasbord of sweets to be consumed throughout the course of the day. Trending far more artisan than its nearby neighbor with French techniques infusing classics from the American cookbook and the bakers themselves acting as servers it was only after several questions that I eventually settled on an order far smaller than I should have liked and beginning my tasting at the small countertop with a moist carrot cake topped in tangy cream cheese I knew right away that none of this one was leaving the store - a similar sentiment shared by later samples, though each was indeed eaten only in part with the rest saved for a later day snack. Moving from cupcake to the only item that would prove the least bit dull, suffice it to say that monkey bread is found better elsewhere, but moving on to arching layers not the least bit burdened by frangipane beneath a shattering shell I'd be really surprised if a better almond croissant can be found in town. Admittedly a bit sugar-saturated at this point it was onward to the dense butter cake that I progressed and, although enthusiasts from the Show Me State may claim the rounded muffin to be unauthentic, the creamy texture was divine - a similar superlative soon to be lavished on the buttery Danish with flavors both savory and sweet to spare, a light smokiness from the baked bourbon tickling the palate as candied pecans crunched with each bite.",4,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Wonderful little ice cream/candy joint right next to the Windsor Restaurant. The interior isn't very large, but it's super inviting and has a very clean/kiddish vibe to it. I think it's the perfect atmosphere for a candy/ice cream joint! They do have a wonderful back patio that is right next to the Windsor patio, but is still separate from it. The patio is very clean and inviting. There are plenty of beautiful flowers and trees to enjoy while eating your meal. The seating and shading are comfy and there are misters to keep you cool. Their menu of ice cream is not very large, but the flavors are unique and are created daily. There are plenty of topping options as well. They have a wide selection of coffees (lattes, cappuccinos, teas, Americanos, etc), as well as toppers to include Soy Milk! I ordered an Iced Americano (12oz for 2$), and my husband ordered an ice cream sandwich. You can choose to create your own sandwich using any of their delicious cookies and ice cream options. They have waffle cones, pretzel cones, and a variety of other options to pair with your ice cream experience. Unfortunately, they do not serve yogurt or sorbet ice cream at this time, a deal breaker for those of us who can't/won't eat dairy!

"For the winter, it's a ramen shop! They've had multiple ramen pop-ups in the past couple of years but I've never been able to come, so I was very excited to try it. Came with a friend on a Thursday night, pretty limited seating, so we had to wait for a little bit. There's a bar with 8 seats or so, and a 4 or 5 small tables set up. They had a tonkotsu, chicken shio, and vegetarian option for ramen. Of course we both had the tonkotsu. I was actually super impressed with the tonkotsu ramen, considering this is Cleveland (haha sorry not sorry). The broth was perfect, rich and savory and meaty, without being too salty or greasy. The tonkotsu ramen came with a piece of Charsiu, marinated soft boiled egg, corn, seaweed, enoki mushrooms and green onion. The ramen noodles were nice and chewy. The Charsiu was so tender and melt-in-your-mouth. The egg was a perfect soft boil and so flavorful! Everything was what I was looking for (but afraid to expect) in a ramen. And I didn't even feel bloated afterwards! Wish there was a little more meat though. There was a chili oil and a chili flake/powder (w cumin, Sichuan peppercorn, salt) that you could add to the ramen. I liked that it wasn't super spicy, so you could get a lot of flavor without burning your mouth. I added both to my ramen. My friend also got the iced tea, which comes in a huge glass bottle, and you get to keep the bottle! I didn't try it because I was feeling sick, but she enjoyed it.

"I definitely love this bakery, but I give it only 4 star because on my recent trip here. When I went it was extremely busy, both the cafe and the line to pick up pastries. The first issue upon arriving was that there were no more trays to pick out pastries and we had to wait about 10 minutes for someone to bring out more. Next, I tried ordering a cake on the Kiosk in the front because I assumed it'd be the fastest way. On the Kiosk, it displayed that most of the cakes were sold out so I just settled for one that was available. Although once I got to the cake case, I saw that they had all the flavors still available. Once I got to the cashier they were able to give me the cake a wanted instead, without troubles. Despite this, I hope they work on keeping the Kiosk more updated. I love all the pastries and I hope to return at a less busy time so I can try one of their drinks!",4,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Negative,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown
Great concept of a two-story ice cream shop in their ice cream factory. The ice cream certainly tastes homemade and the flavors they come up with are always worth a try. The only flavor that I didn't care for was the Christmas Ale ice cream. Way too heavy and decadent for my taste. The staff have the patience of Job with no one being able to make a quick decision. There's just too many good choices.,3,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"Novel is our favorite ice cream place. The prices and ice cream are great, and the staff is friendly and polite.

"Rewind is a matcha specialty cafe which I was really excited to try. I have been here for both ice cream and boba drinks. They have both soft serve and hard scoop artisanal varieties. I ordered the Matcha Madness soft serve which came with chocolate shavings and picky sticks. I found the matcha flavor to be bland unfortunately. The hard scoop ice creams are not available in matcha flavor. On to the drinks, I ordered the strawberry matcha latte at the recommended 75% sweetness. The matcha flavoring was quite prominent, I was very happy with my choice. I would like to try the Matcha Americano next. I also had the Butterfly Strawberry Lemonade. Its colors were so beautiful I hesitated to mix it up but alas, must move forward. This drink is pretty unique in that none of the flavors are distinctive. If someone handed me the drink I would not have guessed it contained strawberries or lemons. It was a little too sweet for me at 75%, I would order 50% next time.",4,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"Love, love, love donut bar. I have gone to the original one located in San Diego. From California to Nevada, awesome job chef! Donuts are still amazing, coffee is delectable, and staff is awesome!

"It's unclear if this is a temporary location: vinyl banner instead of a real sign outside, only one wall decorated (everything else is painted very bare white), strangely mismatched light wooden trash can, nothing displayed in the glass case... Don't expect to be offered samples like the local artisan ice cream or gelato shops (or even Baskin Robbins), as there is no ice cream on display and employees won't offer. I was greeted with ""For here or to go?"" which better suits a place with prices that are half of what this shop is charging. For some reason they were playing awful ""screaming for singing"" with electric guitar music. While I'm not expecting old-school soda shoppe/diner music, this was awful. Minus 1 star. $6.75 after tax+$1 for tip = almost $8 for my ""20 oz"" (cup size, not really that much soda, due to foam and overflow) float. Very overpriced (minus the second star), considering the ice cream did not have a pronounced vanilla flavor (was more ""grocery store"" vanilla as opposed to a French or Vanilla Bean flavor) and had a somewhat icy texture. It was ""okay"" and the root beer itself was a drinkable chilled temperature. The worker brought the root beer float out with the styrofoam to-go cup covered completely with streams of overflowing soda (minus a third star). Obviously he had not wiped it down and replied with ""there are napkins on your table"" when I discretely asked for napkins while pointing to the big mess. The young man did apologize after I had thoroughly wiped down the cup, removed the lid which was causing the overflow, and wiped it down again. The correct ""good customer service"" response should have been to quickly realize the mistake (it never should have happened in the first place), acknowledge it, apologize, and wipe down the cup with a clean, wet cloth while offering to ""top up"" the root beer in the float. I don't think these young, new employees have been trained or empowered to give excellent customer service though. A big problem is (I assume as I didn't get one) they don't have domed lids, so the shake's froth gets all over when they smash down the ice cream with a normal flat soda lid. I'm sure it would be even more horrific with whipped cream and a cherry. Please use domed lids! I am not giving them one star as they're local and still probably in the stage of figuring things out, and my float wasn't bad after all. I appreciate that the young man apologized for the messy cup, but it was ""too little, too late."" I do not see myself coming back, due to the high price, mediocre quality, and untrained customer service.",2,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
"Yoooo, Mitchell's is the BEST. It's family owned, heavily involved in the community, & makes the best ice cream in town, hands down.

"Omg so yummy!!! We came out here on a Saturday night to try their famous dough melt. Of course, after seeing the Yelp pics, we had to try to cookie monster ice cream. It was so creamy and delicious! My husband and I split a dough melt with the cookie monster ice cream with waffle cone pieces (you get to choose a topping on the ice cream in the dough melt too!). We could've probably gotten our own because they tasted so good, but we definitely would've been overly full because they are quite big! I like the set-up of the outdoor seating area because they have plenty of room, and I think we may have snagged a seat if it weren't so hot out ;) we opted to eat in the car only for that reason! My husband is not one to go out of the way to get food/dessert, but he said ""this was definitely worth the 30 minute drive,"" so we will for sure be back!",5,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown

"Had read about this place last time I was in Phoenix and we happened to be in the Scottsdale area so decided to stop in. Had a line at 2:30pm, but moved pretty quickly. Seating is limited, but they do have a few tables outside. Also saw some board games coming out of line by the restrooms if you just want to chill for awhile. They have some ""awards"" on the wall while you are waiting to order with the menu placed behind them and the special on a small board on the counter. They will offer samples of you ask, but didn't seem overly friendly about it. Now to the Ice Cream, everyone enjoyed their choices with the possible exception of the Real Mint Chip. Found you either loved it or hated it. The Salted Caramel was a hit as was the Belgian Chocolate. I don't know if I'd go out of my way, but if in the area would visit again.",4,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,Positive
"One of the best ice cream I've ever had. Can't remember the full names but on the two times I came here I ordered bourbon, strawberry (not the original strawberry) and taro coconut and all were so amazing. I even sampled multiple other flavors such as honey lavender, the peanut butter one, cookie and more. The ice cream is rich and creamy without being too overpowering. I also tried their Donut sandwhich and I really liked their donut as well. It was a pretty light donut so it complimented the ice cream very well, but I prefer just getting a cone or cup. The service was quick and incredible. I sampled almost all the flavors before choosing the flavors I wanted to order and although they were a little busy they did not seem to mind at all. 10/10 highly recommend this place, so delicious!",5,Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown

"This bakery is probably the best place we ate at while in Charlotte. It's cute, modern, chic and they sell great pastries. The dÃ©cor is nice (we ate in some kind of atrium, a covered outdoor area, didn't love it), I'd recommend eating in the actual cafÃ©, there's plenty to look at it (cool furniture, artwork, etc) and they play cool music. Service is nice, we got some lunch here, a few tartines (European style open sandwich, just one baguette slice on the bottom), mine (vegetarian) with pesto, mozarella and tomatoes (I got half), my husband got the full tartine - the ham and Gruyere cheese one. They weren't as good as the ones I had in Paris, but they were decent. Nice choice for a snack, they have a great selection of European sodas (San Pellegrino, etc). We got some chocolate croissants for the next morning's breakfast (they were very good) and delicious chocolate Ã©clairs to go (which were the best we had in a long time, the custard was just right). Amelie is a cute place to hang out for breakfast, lunch, meet with a friend. If you live in the area or visit Charlotte, give it a try, it won't disappoint.

"I've actually been trying to come here since the last time I visited Las Vegas but it always seem to be closed when I tried to go. I FINALLY WENT! They had so many different pastries and baked goods to choose one. It took me a while to decide on the Better Nutter (reinvented nutter butter) and a tropezienne (not really sure if that's spelled correctly). My boyfriend got the strawberry croissant and the pain au chocolat. I really enjoyed the Better Nutter. It was very tasty, and brought back the memories of eating Nutter Butters but SOOOOO MUCH BETTER. I'd definitely come back for these =] highly recommended The tropezienne is like a bready pastry with cream in the middle, there was also strawberry slices in it. It was good but if I could only choose one I'd go for the Better Nutter. I also tried the strawberry croissant, and that was very tasty also.

My friend knocked on the window to get her attention, nothing. The other customer also knocked but nothing. When they walked away I called the business, but it was just an automated machine.

A bit of a mixed bag from this place. We had one of the lobster tails and it was amazing. Light and crispy with a delicious filling. The cannoli on the other hand was virtually inedible. The cream inside was very grainy and the cannoli shell was far from crisp. We each tried one small bite and threw the rest away.

"Bon Appetit named Sweet Republic a Top 10 Ice Cream Shop, so when I was in Phoenix, I went out of my way to pay them a visit. Thankfully, not too far out of my way. I had high expectations because of all the accolades bestowed on this shop by foodies in the know. My first impression was not good. It's located in a strip mall, with rickety outdoor tables and chairs situated in between two trash cans. The appearance does improve once you get in the front door. It's decorated nicely and there were a couple teenagers at a table playing board games they got from the stash of games at the back of the shop. It had a nice vibe. They rotate their flavors of ice cream and sorbet so you get what you get. Too bad the menu on the wall didn't match what was in the cases. I was disappointed they didn't have a chocolate peanut butter cup flavor. Instead, they had Peanut Butter Chip, which was churned peanuts with chocolate flakes. Nothing else looked appealing to me so that's what I ordered. The texture was weird- kind of icy, not creamy. There were little pieces of peanuts that didn't help matters and the teensy flakes of dark chocolate were not abundant enough to add to the flavor. It was altogether odd. My sister had lemon sorbet and her review was, ""Meh."" We couldn't really figure out what was so great about this place.",2,Negative,Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,unknown

It's very creative and artsy. It is super cozy and very relaxing. They serve great sandwiches like Turkey and Brie. They also have great pastries, now of course, if you don't like petit fours and croissants, tarts and quiche, don't go. I preferably was looking for cheesecake on first trip and was kindly told it's a French Bakery lol So on my next trip I tried out a few of their cream cheese croissants. Now that was heaven!
